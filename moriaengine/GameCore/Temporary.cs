	//This class has methods which are called when various packets are recieved from clients.
	//These methods exist to note things that should be implemented later, but aren't yet.
	//If you want to implement something that is in here, go right ahead, but do a search on the method name
	//you're replacing to find out what calls it, and change the calls to point to your new method
	//(And then delete or comment out the method here).

	//(I'm basically going through and adding a bunch of packets without worrying about
	// making systems to hook them up to, etc.)

	//Also, at the bottom of this file, outside the class itself, there is a list of new methods in OutPackets.cs
	//which can be used to send information to the client. The listed methods aren't actually used by anything presently,
	//but that's what the list is for - so nobody accidentally reimplements a packet-sending method which already exists
	//and is only waiting for someone to come along and use it.

	//-SL

	//Most of these methods will print debug information when they are called, and all of them have extensive
	//documentation to aid implementation. I recommend keeping the documentation, and existing parameters and
	//return values, to make things as easy for you as possible.

	//Sanity checks exist to verify assumptions. One good guideline is not to assume something that isn't tested
	//by a sanity check. If you're going to assume something which isn't checked, add a sanity check for it.
	//Sanity checks only exist in the debug build, so they won't slow down the release builds.

			Method: AnimRequest
				This is called when the client requests to bow, salute, etc. The client sends

				sends its anims in a different packet) (The debug build looks at the string
				and treats anything other than "bow" or "salute" as a suspicious error - which is likely to
				get someone's attention if they do it and get kicked, which should get them to report
				it as a bug, hopefully, which would be what it is (assuming they hadn't hacked the client
				to send "flurble" or something))
