I know that it's not common to have the binaries used by given project in it's cvs, but we don't have many of them, so I decided to keep them here for convenience.

SteamDoc.dll
This is Steamengine's co-project, hosted in our cvs as module steamdoc. 
It uses .NET attributes instead of the /// comments to create XML doc files out of assemblies.
The advantage is that the comments are easily accessible from the running program itself by reflection, so that they can be displayed on fly as help for various commands etc.

grammatica-1.4.jar
This is obviously not a referenced library as it is in java :) It is the compiler generator for our LSscript engine.
steamengine/src/LScript/generate.bat uses this jar to generate the proper sources out of LScript_strict.grammar


ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll
zip.dll
lzip.dll
Two implementations of the zipping algorhitm.
Currently they're used just by the script BackupsManager.cs, but hey they can come handy in more cases later.



NAnt.Core.dll
THe Nant core (obviously ;) used by Common to programatically execute building tasks. 

NAnt.*.dll
Additional Nant libraries


log4net.dll
Used by Nant. It's a logging library of some sort, 
I might as well look into it later to see if we couldn't use it for steamengine itself as well.
