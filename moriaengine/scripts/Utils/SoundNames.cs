	//Anything tabbed over in the enum is a name from sound.mul - generally those are shortened and made confusing (most are 8 character filenames, plus a ".wav" extension), but I wrote what the abbreviations meant for most of them. :P
	//The stuff that isn't tabbed over, I named myself, and the name reflects what they sounded like to me. (SL)
	//On some things they actually sounded to me like what sound.mul says they are, so there's nothing tabbed over there.
	//Some sounds are longer than others, and most of those had _l at the end of their filename in sound.mul, and I changed that to _Long. I omitted it on the "Ambient" sounds though.
	
	//Character sounds are usually in groups of 5:
	//	Angry
	//	Normal
	//	Attacking
	//	Hurt
	//	Dying
	
	//Some characters have only three sounds, attacking, hurt, and dying (They lack "Angry" and "Normal").
	//	Those'll be called ShortBase[Name]
	//Some have four, those are called MediumBase[Name]. They have everything but the "Normal" sound.
	//The filenames in sound.mul for character sounds are [heavily abbreviated character name][1-5].wav,
	//so I haven't included tabbed over definitions for those, and I haven't included definitions for most
	//of the character sounds. I've only included definitions for the first for each character, but the name
	//indicates how many sounds are in it (see above).
	
	//In AOS 2D the sounds go from 0 to 1236, but sounds.mul can hold 4096 sounds.
	//Note: Sound 856 doesn't exist. It's the only one missing.
	
	//Thankfully, sound 407 and higher have decent names... Well, almost. "dragon_red_atk3_a". Well, it's better than "erthel4.wav" or "gispidr2.wav" or "gscorp1.wav" (That one puzzled me for a few seconds .oO("What's a gs corp?")...
	
	//Some of the sounds I haven't listened to, and just used the name from sound.mul. Some have a _ before their name, but that simply means that there was another in here with the same name already. In fact, there's also one which there are three sounds with the same filename - poison, so the third gets two _s.
