Currently, I'm trying to unify the building process of Steamengine with NAnt, 
so that we won't have to keep all the various make files for various platforms/OSes, 
and I'd also like to use it from inside steamengine to build scripts, etc.

To have it working, you need to install NAnt properly, i.e. unzip it into some folder and point your system PATH to it,
that means adding something like "C:\Program files\Nant\bin" to your PATH. 
Edit: ...Not anymore. I put the Nant.exe with the needed .dlls into /bin, and the bats point to them. 
So you do not really need NAnt installed.


It's all far from done, but the bat files in steamengine root are already using the nant build file
and they can already build enough for the steamengine to start.
