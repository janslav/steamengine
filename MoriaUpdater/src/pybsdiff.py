#this and pybspatch are wrappers for the bsdiff module, aiming to use the same diff files the bsdiff executables themselves create and consume
#the implementation is based on the bsdiff source and the following format definition:

#from bspatch.c:
#File format:
#    0      8    "BSDIFF40"
#    8      8    X
#    16     8    Y
#    24     8    sizeof(newfile)
#    32     X    bzip2(control block)
#    32+X   Y    bzip2(diff block)
#    32+X+Y ???  bzip2(extra block)
#with control block a set of triples (x,y,z) meaning "add x bytes
#from oldfile to x bytes from the diff block; copy y bytes from the
#extra block; seek forwards in oldfile by z bytes".
