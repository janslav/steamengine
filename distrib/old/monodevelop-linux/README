The version MonoDevelop which I used to create the project files (0.7) is not able (or I dont know how) to work with project files that are not stored locally in the project directory. So, as a (temporary?) workaround, I made a link called "link" in each of the project directories (common, steamengine, ...) which was linked to the directories in the /src, which contain the actual sources. Through this link I then added the files, and it seemed enough to fool the MonoDevelop to think they are local. That means you have to create such directory links too, because they are not transferable through cvs. I think.
