Steamengine is built completely by Nant. Not only the core and console, but also 
the scripts and the generated code, the building of which is invoked by the core.

To have it working, you need to install NAnt properly, i.e. unzip it into some 
folder and point your system PATH to it, that means adding something like 
"C:\Program files\Nant\bin" to your PATH. 
Edit: ...Not anymore. I put the Nant.exe with the needed .dlls into /bin, and 
the bats point to them. So you do not really need NAnt installed.

It is still possible, to some extent, to build by visual studio, but only for
purposes of checking for compile-time errors... the built binaries won't probably 
work properly (different file names etc.)
