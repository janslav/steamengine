from sphereserver forums about Armor:

SphereServer 55i? Each armor part has its own coefficient:

LAYER_HELM - 0.1
LAYER_COLLAR (gorget) - 0.05
LAYER_SHIRT, LAYER_CHEST, LAYER_TUNIC, LAYER_CAPE, LAYER_ROBE - 0.1
LAYER_SHIRT, LAYER_CHEST, LAYER_TUNIC, LAYER_ROBE - 0.3
LAYER_ARMS, LAYER_CAPE, LAYER_ROBE - 0.1
LAYER_GLOVES - 0.1
LAYER_PANTS, LAYER_SKIRT, LAYER_HALF_APRON, LAYER_ROBE, LAYER_LEGS - 0.2
LAYER_SHOES, LAYER_LEGS - 0.05

Yes, some layers are calculating twice or even three or four times (like LAYER_ROBE). Your example:
Robe with AC=25: 25*0.1+25*0.3+25*0.1+25*0.2=2.5+7.5+5+2.5=17. Why? Because each man have eight body part, that could be damaged: head, neck, back, trunk, two arms, two hands, two legs and two foots. So, robe closes trunk (coefficient 0.3), back (0.1), arms (0.1) and legs (0.2).

But if there is more powerful armor, armor with less AC doesn't take part in calculus. For example, you have Robe with AC=25 and Arms with AC=30. In that case Robe return just 25*0.3+25*0.1+25*0.2=15, because Arms has more AC number and it reserve its coefficient — 0.1. Total AC will be 15 (from Robe) + 30*0.1=3 (from Arms) = 18.
