500281	...but there is no room in your backpack.
500282	You create the potion and pour it into the keg.
500283	That container is too full to hold your potion.
500284	You are wise enough not to add a different type of potion to that keg.
500285	You are unsure what is in the keg, and decide not to add your mixture to it.
500286	You were unable to complete your work before you died.
500287	You fail to create a useful potion.

500312	You cannot reach that.
500313	The flask is empty.

500331	The spirits of the dead are not the province of animal lore.
500332	I am too far away to do that.
500333	You are to weary to discern anything useful.

500357	If this lever ever did anything, it doesn't do it anymore.
500358	The lever feels loose, and you realize it no longer controls anything.
500359	You flip the lever and think you hear something, but realize it was just your imagination.
500360	The lever flips without effort, doing nothing.
500361	You flip the lever, and now its even more broken than before!

503063	Bless thee sir, for that cause I will teach you to track it down for free!
503064	Your skill level increases.
503065	I wish I could help you, but there is nothing more I can do to aid you on your quest.
503066	It is good to have you back sir, but I have done all I can for thee, it is now up to you to save our village.
503067	Hello again! Have you found a smith's hammer for me yet?  I can't make that sword without it!
503068	Greetings my friend, have you brought me a longsword?
503069	Greetings again, sir.  Have you had any luck on your quest?
503070	Ah, a guest in my home, greetings my friend!
503071	The dragon won't be a problem after I make you an enchanted sword, but I need a smith's hammer to do so.
503072	The dragon won't be a problem after I make you an enchanted sword, but I need an ordinary longsword to do so.
503073	With the sword I gave you, you should be able to kill the dragon, perhaps in a single blow!
503074	Ahh, a young dragonslayer are you?  Well you will need help.  Bring me a smith's hammer, and I can make you an enchanted sword to slay the beast with!
503075	You should be able to get a smith's hammer from the blacksmith in town for a modest price.

503081	What was it you needed help with?
503082	Given a smith's hammer and an ordinary longsword, I can make an enchanted sword!
503083	I'll need a regular longsword to make an enchanted sword of.
503084	That sword does potent damage, but has very limited use.
503085	I can make an enchanted sword, but I'll need a smith's hammer and an ordinary longsword to do so.
503086	I have already made you a glass sword, that is all I can do for you.
503087	Oops, I dropped it.
503088	Yes, with this I can make you an enchanted sword to slay the dragon with!  All I need now is your longsword... you do have one don't you?
503089	Good, now I will make your glass sword.  Remember you can only use it once, and I cannot make another!
503090	The sage chants for a moment, and hits your longsword with the hammer shattering the steel and revealing a blade of glass!
503091	I have already made you a glass sword, that is all I can do for you.

Try to open the doors in front of you. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000013	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Perfect! Did you notice how the doors opened when you <B>used</B> them? Now you can walk into the next room. Please go through the open door. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000014	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we will learn more about your character, or avatar. An avatar is your in-game representation. It is how other people can interact with you. By <B>using</B> your avatar you can open your <B>Paperdoll</B>. The paperdoll allows you to see your current status, access important information and abilities, and customize your character. Double Left Click your cursor on yourself to open your paperdoll. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000015	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is your paperdoll. It shows you what clothing you are currently wearing and what items you have equipped.

1000018	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>At the bottom, the <B>Status</B> button will give you information about your Avatar's attributes and statistics. Before we cover those, let's learn about the <B>Backpack</B>. Your backpack is in the lower right corner of your paperdoll. It is where all of your items are stored when you are not wearing or using them. It can be opened by using it. Open it now by double left clicking the cursor on it. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000019	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Wonderful! This is your backpack. It is where you can put the items that you find and need during your adventures through Britannia. Right now, there is a banana inside your backpack. We're going to use it to learn a few more ways you can interact with items. To <B>Look</B> at an item in the world, single left click on it with the cursor. A description will appear above the item when you do this. Look at the banana by moving the cursor over the banana and clicking the left mouse button once. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000020	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>See how the description appears above the object? You can look at any object in the world with a single left click. Let's learn how to pick up things. Picking up an object is done by single, left clicking on it, just as you did to look at it, and then holding the mouse button down. You can then drag the item around. The item will stick to the end of the mouse cursor while you are holding it. Pick up the banana by moving the mouse cursor over it, and left clicking and holding the left mouse button down. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000021	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>GREAT! You have now picked up the banana. Move the mouse cursor around. See how the banana moves accordingly and follows it? This is how you <B>Move</B> objects around in Britannia. Move the mouse cursor back over the backpack and release the left button. This will drop the banana back inside your backpack. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000022	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You appear to have missed your backpack! The banana has been returned to your backpack for you. Clicking on, holding and dragging is how things can be moved around in the world. Objects in your backpack can be <B>Used</B> just like objects in the world can be used. For example, double left clicking on the banana will let you <B>Eat</B> it. Eat the banana now. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000023	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now you know how to <B>Move</B> an object in the world. Objects in your backpack can be <B>Used</B> just like objects in the world. For example, moving the cursor over the banana and double-clicking the left mouse button will let you <B>Eat</B> it. Eat the banana now. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000024	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>YUM! You ate the banana. There is now a blue Hat in your backpack. Clothing and other equipment can be worn and removed. This is done by picking up and dragging the equipment over to your paperdoll. First, pick up the hat. Again, you do this by moving the cursor over it, and clicking and holding down the left mouse button on it. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000025	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You are now holding the hat. Be careful! You don't want to release the mouse button, as that would drop it. Drag the hat over to your head in the paperdoll and release the button. Doing this will <B>Equip</B> the hat. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000026	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Oops! You appear to have dropped the hat! I have returned it to your backpack. Try to pick up the hat again. Do this by moving the cursor over it, and left clicking and holding down the button. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000027	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>GREAT! You have <B>Equipped</B> the hat. See how it appears on your avatar as well as your paperdoll? You can equip clothing, weapons and armor in the same way as the hat. Now, let's learn how to take it off. Move the mouse cursor over the hat on your paperdoll, and left click and hold down the mouse button to pick it up. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000028	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now you are holding the hat again. Drag the hat over the backpack and release the left mouse button to drop it in. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000029	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Oops! You appear to have missed the backpack! The hat has been returned to your backpack. Now that you know how to use and manipulate items in the world we are going to learn a little bit about moving the in-game windows around. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000030	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Wonderful! Now that you know how to use and manipulate items in the world we are going to learn a little bit about moving the in-game windows around. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000031	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>First, look in the lower right corner of your paperdoll. Do you see the <B>Dash symbol (-)</B>? This is the <B>Minimize</B> button. It appears on almost all of the windows in Ultima Online. Single left clicking on it will shrink down the window for convenience. Left click on the paperdoll minimize button, or dash symbol. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000032	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>See how the paperdoll has shrunk down to a button-looking window that says <B>Character</B>? This is the minimized version of the paperdoll window. It can be moved around by left clicking and dragging just like any other window. To restore the paperdoll, you just double left click on the Character window. Double left click on it now.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000033	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we'll learn how to <B>Close</B> a window. To close any window, simply single right click on it. Single right click on your paperdoll window. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000034	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>To reopen your paperdoll, simply double left click on your avatar. Now you know how to move, minimize, restore, and close all of the windows available to you. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000035	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now you'll have a chance to use a little of what you have just learned. Inside of this room is a Red <B>Moongate</B>. A Moongate is a magical portal, which will teleport you elsewhere. The moongate is inside the smaller room with 8 doors. Walk over to these doors, and <B>Use</B> them. (Hint: Double left click on the doors!). After you have opened the doors, walk into the moongate. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000036	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to learn more about your avatar. Move the mouse cursor over your avatar. Now single click the left mouse button, hold it down, and drag the cursor off of your character. Press the Next button when you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000037	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is your <B>Status Bar</B>. It is a handy representation of your avatar's characteristics. There are 3 major characteristics shown here. The first, and most important is the topmost bar. This represents your avatar's <B>Health</B>. Health shows you how hurt your character is. Your Health decreases when you are wounded. As your Health drops lower, the blue bar will shrink. Let's see what this looks like. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000038	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Your Health has been lowered to half. See how the bar is now half blue and half red? The blue portion of the bar shows you how close you are to your maximum in that characteristic. So if you have very little blue left, watch out! Your other characteristics will work the same way. Health regenerates naturally over time. Press the Next button to continue and restore your Health to full. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000039	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The next characteristic, shown as the middle bar, is <B>Mana</B>. Mana shows you how much magical energy that your character has available. Casting a spell will decrease your available Mana. Mana regenerates naturally over time. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000040	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The last characteristic is the bottom bar. This bar measures your current <B>Stamina</B>. The stamina bar lets you know how tired you are. Running, fighting, and other physical activities will decrease your stamina. Be careful not to let your stamina reach 0, as you will become too tired to move! Stamina, just like Health and Mana, regenerates over time. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000041	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to take a closer look at your status. The Status Bar can be maximized to a more detailed Status window by double left clicking on the bar. Maximize the bar now. Press the Next button when you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000042	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>As you can see this window gives you much more detail about your character. It gives you the number value of your current and maximum Health, Mana, and Stamina, as well as several other statistics. The first statistic, <B>STR</B> is your <B>Strength</B>. This is a measure of how strong and durable your avatar is. The higher your strength is, the more Health you have, and the more you excel at physical activity. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000043	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The next statistic is <B>DEX</B> which stands for your <B>Dexterity</B>. This represents how agile and quick you are. If your Dexterity is very high, you will be able to dodge attacks, and perform physical activities more quickly. Dexterity also affects the amount of Stamina you have. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000044	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The last Statistic is <B>INT</B> which is for your <B>Intelligence</B>. This represents how smart you are. A character with a high Intelligence will excel at mental activities such as spell casting. Intelligence also determines the amount of Mana that you have available. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000045	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Next, <B>SEX</B> shows whether your character is Male or Female. Below that is <B>AR</B> or Armor Rating. AR represents how well protected your character is. The higher the AR, the better protected from damage you are. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000046	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Next are the number values of Health, Stamina and Mana. Below that is <B>Gold</B>. This tells you how much money you currently have. Below that is <B>Weight</B>. Weight is an indicator of how much you are carrying. The more weight you are carrying, the more stamina you will lose during normal physical activity. Excessive weight will prevent you from moving at all! Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000047	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now that you are more familiar with your character, close the Status window with a single right click. Now follow the Red footprints down the hall. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000048	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Continue to follow the footprints into the next room. Inside you will see a number of avatars. These are NPC's, or Non-Player Characters. NPC's are avatars that are run by the game. In this case, these NPC's are <B>Shopkeepers</B>. Shopkeepers will buy and sell items from players. Walk over to one of the NPC's and stand right next to them. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000049	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>NPC's have a paperdolls just like you do. You open an NPC's paperdoll, just as you would open your own.  Simply double left click on them. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000050	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The NPC paperdoll shows information about the NPC just as yours does. The clothing and equipment worn are shown as well as the NPC's name and profession. The <B>Status</B> of an NPC can be opened from the paperdoll as well. Close the NPC Paperdoll with a single right click. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000051	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to learn how to buy and sell from an NPC. NPC's respond to speech, just like players do, but they require gold for their wares. Some gold has been placed in your backpack. Like all of your other items, gold is stored in your backpack. Open your paperdoll with a double left click on your avatar. Then, open your backpack with a double left click. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000052	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now close your Paperdoll. (HINT: Single right click on it.). Your backpack will remain open. Inside of your backpack you will see some <B>Gold</B>. Looking at the stack of gold will show you the amount you possess. You currently have 10 gold pieces. We are going to use this gold to buy something from this Shopkeeper. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000053	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>To let a NPC shopkeeper know you wish to buy from them, you must type in <B>Vendor Buy</B>. Type this in now and press the Enter key. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000054	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is the <B>Buy</B> window. Here you can make your selection from the wares of a shop. In this case, this vendor sells loaves of bread. The top portion of the window shows the name of the item, the cost, and the amount available. The bottom portion will display what items you have selected as well as the total cost of your items. Let's purchase a loaf of bread. This is done by double-clicking the left mouse button on the <B>Bread</B> description in the top window. Press the Next button after you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000055	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The available loaves of bread has been dropped by one and a loaf of bread has been placed in the bottom portion of the window. You are able to increase and decrease the quantity of items by using the <B>+ (plus)</B> and <B>-(minus)</B> buttons on the bottom half of the window.  To complete the transaction, single left click on the large red checkmark at the bottom left of the window. Press the Next button after you have done this.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000056	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Great! Now you have a loaf of bread in your backpack. But you are also a few gold poorer. You only have 4 gold now. You can sell items to NPC's as well. They won't pay as much for an item as it is worth though. It's just not profitable for them! Let's sell the loaf of bread back to the NPC. Type <B>Vendor Sell</B>, and press the enter key. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000057	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The <B>Sell</B> window is arranged the same way as the Buy window. Instead of the shopkeeper's items at the top of the window, <B>your</B> items are listed. Double-click the left mouse button on the loaf of bread description. It will appear in the bottom portion of the window. Note the amount the NPC will pay for the bread is around half of what you originally paid for it. Now single left click on the large Checkmark to finish the sale. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000058	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You have sold the bread! The appropriate amount of gold has been placed in your backpack and was neatly collected back into your stack of gold. Now that you are familiar with buying and selling from NPC's, let's move on to some combat! Follow the blue footprints down the hall. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000059	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Continue following the blue footprints.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000060	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>These creatures are <B>Mongbats</B>. Mongbats are but one type of monster that plagues the people of Britannia. Monsters are like NPC's, but they do not have a paperdoll. They do have a simple status bar much like your own. To open the monster's status bar, left click on the mongbat, hold and drag the mouse off of it. Press the Next button when you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000061	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is the Monster's status bar. It only shows the monster's Health. Like your status bar, the blue bar will gradually shrink as the monster gets closer and closer to death. When the bar is totally red, the monster will die. Now open your own status bar. Left click and drag the mouse off of you. Press the Next button when you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000062	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to learn how to go into <B>Combat</B> mode. Combat mode will allow you to attack monsters and other players. Press <B>ALT-C</B> (the ALT key and the C key at the same time). See how your status bar changes to a red color, and your avatar changes his stance? This is <B>Combat</B> mode, and it means you are ready to fight. Pressing ALT-C again will take you out of combat mode. Practice going in and out of combat mode a few times. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000063	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You can fight with just your fists, but to do more damage, you should use a weapon. To use one you must first equip it. A cutlass has been placed in your backpack for you to use. Open your paperdoll (Double left click on your avatar), and open your backpack. (Double left click on the backpack). To equip it we need to pick it up. Left click, hold and drag the cutlass out of the backpack. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000064	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Great! You have picked up the cutlass. Drag it onto your paperdoll and release the left mouse button to equip it. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000065	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Oops! You appear to have missed! The cutlass has been returned to your backpack. Left click and hold on it and drag it on to your paperdoll to equip it. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000066	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Your weapon is now equipped. Close your paperdoll and backpack with a single right click on each. Now you are ready to <B>Attack</B> a monster. Go into combat mode, if you are not already. (Use <B>ALT-C</B> until your character is in his aggressive stance.) Open the mongbat's status bar with a left click hold and drag (if you had closed it). Then, move right next to a monster and attack it. To attack a monster <B>Use</B> it while you are in Combat mode. Do this now. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000067	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You are now <B>Attacking</B> the monster! You will notice the mongbat has changed color and has a mini-health bar under it. This lets you know what you are in combat with. You will continue to attack the mongbat until it dies. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000068	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>HURRAH! You killed the monster. Now, <B>Use</B> the monster's corpse. This will allow you to take any treasure that the monster has. Double left click on the corpse of the monster, now. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000069	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is the Monster's corpse. Inside will be any equipment or treasure that the monster was carrying and has for the taking. In this case, the mongbat had a Crystal Ball. Pick up the Crystal ball with a Left click and hold. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000070	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now drag the Crystal ball directly onto your avatar and release the left mouse button. This will allow you to pick up items from the world without opening your backpack. They will go directly into your backpack when dropped this way. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000071	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You appear to have missed dropping on yourself. The crystal ball has been returned to the monster's corpse window. Now click and drag the Crystal ball directly onto your avatar. This will allow you to pick up items from the world without opening your backpack. They will go directly into your backpack when dropped this way. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000072	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Congratulations! You now know how to kill monsters and take their treasure. To finish up, follow the Blue Footprints. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

1000074	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This red Moongate will take you to Haven. Haven is a city where you will continue your learning. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

1002057	Cartography
1002058	The cartography skill has two primary uses.  It can be used to create one of several types of maps. Secondly, it is used to decode treasure maps that are sometimes found as loot on monsters.
1002059	To create a new map, first you must obtain a blank map. Then, use your cartography skill from the skill list, and click on the blank map. A window will appear giving you a choice of map types. Select the one that you would like to create. Your chances of success, and the range and quality of your map will be determined by your skill level. Your location will be the center of the map.
1002060	To decode a treasure map, simply double click it. If your cartography skill is high enough, you will successfully decode the map. After you have decoded the map, you must also be the person to dig up the treasure using the mining skill.
1002061	This skill is useful for traveling on a boat. You can plot your course on the map, then give the map to your tillerman. Simply say "Start" and he will begin to travel the course you have plotted.
1002062	This skill is also useful to make maps for adventurers, selling maps of popular areas (such as dungeons), and selling maps to seafarers.
1002063	Cooking
1002064	Cooking allows you to bake raw food into tastier cooked food. First you must locate or build a fire. Campfires or forges will do for most dishes, however, some may require an oven. Once you have found a source of heat, double-click the food item you wish to cook, then target the forge, campfire, or oven. The cooking skill also allows you to try to combine certain foods to make new dishes.
1002065	Detecting Hidden
1002066	Detect Hidden is  useful skill in several regards. Proficiency in this skill will allow you to detect hidden players, find traps on trapped chests, and detect dungeon traps. The higher your level of proficiency with this skill, the larger your search radius will be, and the greater chance you have of detecting other sorts of traps.
1002067	To use Detect Hidden, simply use the skill from the skill list, and target the area or object you wish to search. When you successfully detect a trap, you will "notice something funny" about the object or area, and it will be revealed to all.
1002068	As your skill in Detecting Hidden items increases, you may even begin to see traps automatically. This is a very difficult skill to learn, and may start happening after you have passed a skill level of 80 in this skill. Your ability to detect traps in this manner is dependent on the trap level and difficulty, and should not be relied upon in all situations.
1002069	Another useful application for this skill involves the homeowner. If you are the homeowner, or friend to a house, and use the detect hidden skill in your household, you will reveal any players that may be hidden there.
1002070	Evaluate Intelligence
1002071	Evaluating intelligence allows you to learn certain things about the mental makeup of the beings you select.

Select the person or monster on which you would like to use your evaluate intelligence skill.  If you are successful, you will determine their relative intelligence, and perhaps their current mana level.  You will not be able to use the evaluate intelligence skill on Shopkeepers or Vendors.
1002073	Fencing
1002074	Fencing is a melee combat skill, which allows for an quick attack style of fighting.  A fencer is capable of using a kryss, spear, pitchfork, war fork, short spear or dagger in combat to great effect.
1002075	Fencing, like the other melee combat skills, requires that you have the appropriate weapon equipped.  Once you have the weapon equipped you will need to enter war mode.  You will need to double-click on an opponent to attack them.
1002076	Fishing
1002077	Use of the fishing skill will allow you to catch fish from large bodies of water. Double-click on a fishing pole, then click on a body of water. If successful, you will catch a fish. Success with this skill also depends on the availability of fish in that specific area. You can also catch other items, including treasure maps and SOS messages in bottles.
1002078	Forensic Evaluation
1002079	Use of this skill will allow you to find information about a corpse, and the events surrounding its demise. Use this skill by clicking the jewel in your skill list. You will be given a targeting cursor, target the corpse and you will be given information about the circumstances surrounding the demise. The higher your skill level, the higher your chances of determining these events, and the accuracy of your description.
1002080	This skill is also useful for other reasons. By using this skill on a living person, you may be able to determine their membership in the Thieves guild. Your ability to determine this is based on their skill level as a thief.
1002081	You can also use your detective skills to determine who recently picked the locks on locked containers and determine members of the Thieves Guild. Simply use the Forensic Evaluation skill, and target the item you wish to examine. You must be a skilled detective to begin this practice, as you will not be able to begin learning this skill until you have a skill level of 40.
1002082	Healing
1002083	Use of the healing skill will allow you to heal yourself or other players. To use the skill, simply double click a bandage, and target yourself or the person you wish to heal. If you are successful in your efforts, the recipient will regain health, and the bandage will be used up. To create bandages, simply use scissors on cloth.
1002084	If you are healing another player, you must be near them during your efforts, if you leave their vicinity, your efforts will be in vain. If you are disturbed during your work, your fingers can easily slip, and your efforts will have less or no effect.
1002085	A highly skilled healer may be able to cure poisons or even resurrect other players. To accomplish this, you must be skilled in both healing, and anatomy. To cure poison, you must have a minimum of 60 skill in each area, and above 80 skill in each area, you may be able to resurrect ghosts.
1002086	Herding
1002087	Use of this skill will allow you to herd animals. To use this skill you must have a shepherd's crook. Double click the crook, and you will be given a targeting cursor. Simply target the animal you wish to herd, and then click the location you wish the animal to move to. The higher your skill, the more likely you are to successfully herd the animal.
1002088	Hiding
1002089	The hiding skill allows you to become invisible to other players. To use this skill, simply click the gem next to it in the skill list. If successful, you will become invisible to other players and monsters. You will be revealed if you move, speak, cast a spell, loot a body, attack someone or something, and other possible ways. It can be very difficult or impossible to hide while you are being attacked, so make sure to run a good distance away from your enemy and exit combat mode before attempting to hide. While you are hidden, you are not totally impervious to detection or attack. You can be revealed by spellcasters, the Detect Hidden skill, and can be tracked using the tracking skill. You can also take damage from area effect spells, and purple potions. You must remain wary even while hidden.
1002090	Inscription
1002091	This skill is used primarily to transcribe spells onto blank scrolls. To inscribe a spell onto a scroll, you must know the spell, have enough mana, and have the appropriate reagents for that spell in your pack (reagents will be consumed in the attempt). To begin, select the inscription skill from your skill list, then select a blank scroll. A scrolling list will appear which displays all of the spells you are capable of casting. From this list, select the spell you wish to inscribe.
1002092	To copy a spell from a scroll onto a spellbook, drag the scroll onto the book. Inscription is not necessary to do this.
1002093	To cast a spell from a scroll you can simply double click the scroll, and the spell will be cast. There are intelligence and magery requirements for casting spells from scrolls, but they are substantially lower than the requirements to cast them using magery.
1002094	Item Identification
1002095	Item Identification, if used successfully, will allow you to gather information about the chosen item. To use the skill simply click on the button and then click on the item to be identified. You will be given a description that varies in detail and accuracy depending on your skill level. (Depending on the ability of the user, the evaluation may be off by up to 50%)
1002096	Once you have identified an item, you will retain knowledge about that item.  Others will not benefit from your discovery, however.  They will have to identify the item themselves.
1002097	Lockpicking
1002098	The lockpicking skill is exactly that, it is used to open locked items. In order to attempt to pick a lock, you must have a set of lockpicks in your pack. Lockpicks can be purchased from thief shopkeepers.  Double-click on your lockpicks, and then target the item to be picked. Some locks are harder to pick than others (and some, such as house doors, are impossible to pick). Your skill level will determine your success rate.  If you are successful the lock will be picked, and you can open the item.
1002099	This skill is especially useful in hunting treasure from treasure maps. The treasure chests that are found will be locked and often trapped. Use of this skill along with detect hidden (to find any traps) will prove useful.
1002100	Lumberjacking
1002101	The use of the lumberjacking skill will allow you to gain raw materials in the form of logs. The logs can then be used for carpentry, bowyering, or tinkering. Simply equip a hatchet or an axe, double click the weapon and then click on a tree. If you are successful in recovering wood it will be placed in your pack.
1002102	Mace Fighting
1002103	Mace fighting is a melee combat skill, which allows for an quick attack style of fighting.  A mace fighter is capable of using a War Axe, Club, Hammer Pick, Mace, Magic Wand, Maul, Smithy Hammer, War Hammer, War Mace, Black Staff, Gnarled Staff, Quarterstaff, and Shepherd's Crook in combat to great effect.
1002104	Due to the heavy bashing of a mace weapon, mace fighters have the ability to damage the armor of their opponents and remove their stamina.
1002105	Mace fighting, like the other melee combat skills, requires that you have the appropriate weapon equipped.  Once you have the weapon equipped you will need to enter war mode.  You will need to double-click on an opponent to attack them.
1002106	Magery
1002107	This skill will allow you to cast a variety of spells in the game. The magery skill is automatically checked when you attempt to cast a spell, and your skill level will determine your chances of success in the attempt. To cast a spell, your hands must be free of any items (except a spellbook), you must have a spellbook with the appropriate spell contained therein, and you must have the appropriate reagents in your pack. Simply open the spellbook, choose the spell that you wish to cast, and double click the spell name. You can also click once on the spell name to get a more complete description of the spell, along with a 'tile' that represents the spell. If you wish, you can 'drag' the tile to your play area, and cast the spell by double clicking on the tile. Depending on the spell that you cast, you will be given different options for the next step, but the success or failure of your casting depends on your magery level.
1002108	If your spellbook does not contain a spell you wish to use often, simply acquire a scroll for that spell, and drag it into your spellbook. This spell will be added to the spells available for your use from this book.
1002109	It is also possible to cast a spell from a scroll. The proper reagents and skill are necessary to prepare the scroll initially, so casting from a scroll requires no reagents, and can be done with a lower level of skill.
1002110	Mages benefit greatly from meditation and evaluate intelligence skills.  Meditation improves the rate at which a mage regains lost mana and evaluate intelligence allows a mage to overcome an opponent's resistance to the mage's magic.
1002111	Mining
1002112	Cultivating the mining skill enables you to harvest the seams of ore that lie in the mines and mountains of Britannia. This ore can then be smelted into ingots (using the mining skill) and the ingots can then be used to craft various items, such as armor (using the blacksmithing skill).
1002113	To mine ore you must have either a shovel or a pickaxe in your possession. Double-click on the axe or shovel and then, when the targeting cursor appears, click on a mountainside or a cave wall. If successful, you will mine either a small, medium, or large pile of ore, dependent upon a number of factors. The known ore types, in order of their prevalence, are Iron (the most common), Dull Copper, Shadow Iron, Copper, Bronze, Golden, Agapite, Verite, and Valorite.
1002114	The rarity and chances of finding various ores varies directly with the skill level necessary to mine it. The more rare the ore, the higher the skill level necessary to mine it.
1002115	A miner who is also a tinker will often be able to be self-sufficient.  Tinkers are able to create shovels and pickaxes necessary for miners.
1002116	Musicianship
1002117	Use of the musicianship skill will allow you to play an instrument. The ability to play an instrument is necessary for some other skills such as discordance, provocation, and peacemaking. To use this skill, simply double click the instrument of your choice. A music sample will play if you succeed, but an ugly noise will occur if you fail. The higher your skill level, the greater your chances of playing a pretty tune.
1002118	Parrying
1002119	This skill is used to determine your proficiency at blocking attacks with a shield. If you are using a shield, this skill is checked automatically each time that you are attacked. If successful, your attacker may miss his attack, or do less damage than normal.
1002120	Peacemaking
1002121	Use of the peacemaking skill will allow you to stop all fights in your immediate area. This skill is related to your musicianship skill, and will automatically check this skill when you use peacemaking. To use the skill, you must click the jewel in your skills list, and then click on your instrument (or the game will remember the last instrument that you played). If you are successful, all fights in the immediate area will stop, at least for a moment. The higher your musicianship and peacemaking skills, the more likely you are to be successful.
1002122	Poisoning
1002123	The poisoning skill can be used to poison a weapon or even food and drink. This will cause damage to whoever is attacked with the poisoned weapon, or to whoever consumes the food or drink. To poison a weapon simply use the skill from your skill list, and then select the vial of poison you wish to use, and finally click on the item you wish to poison. If you poison a weapon, you will lose karma.  This item will now be poisoned until you use it. Once the poisoned weapon is used you will have to repeat the process to poison it again. The same process is used to poison food or drink. Select the skill and then click on the vial of poison. Then click on the consumable, and presto! The food or drink is now poisoned for a period of time. To create the vial of poison you will need to have the reagent nightshade, and then mix it in pestle and mortar. Once it is mixed, it will pour into the empty bottle in your pack. You can then use this green potion to poison items.
1002124	When you wish to poison an item, DO NOT double click the green potion first. If you do this, you will drink the poison. This does not give you the results you had hoped for, as you will have just poisoned yourself.
1002125	Provocation
1002126	This skill is used to encourage other creatures to fight one other. You will need a musical instrument to accomplish this task. To use the skill, first select the provocation skill from the skills list, target the instrument you wish to use (or the game will remember the one you last used), and then click in turn on each of the creatures you wish to fight one another. If you are successful the two creatures will fight for a time consistent with their respective natures and dispositions. Please keep in mind that you cannot provoke other characters.
1002127	Reagents
1002128	Black Pearls are rare, and are often referred to as the reagent of movement. When finely ground into a powder, black pearls can invoke spells that teleport of propel the caster to another location.
1002129	Blood Moss takes its name from its reddish color. Prevalent in wetter surroundings (such as marshes or swamps), this type of fungi is a base reagent for spells involving locomotion or animation.
1002130	The ground paste of a ripe bulb of garlic has a reputation for warding off evil. This effect accurately describes its use as a reagent as well. Modern magicians use garlic in spells that protect the caster (or a specified target) or dispel danger.
1002131	Ginseng is hailed as the reagent of health, as its syrup bestows both healing and restoration. Common Britannia folk use it as a home remedy for fatigue and sickness, but true magicians appreciate ginseng for its magical qualities and always keep a healthy portion on hand.
1002132	Mandrake Root is harder to find than other reagents, although it is probably the most commonly used of the eight base reagents. Like blood moss, it thrives in dark, dank, areas, where most dare not venture. Those that do search out this precious root are rewarded by being able to cast spells invoking strength and energy.
1002133	The nightshade plant is as deadly as its long-standing reputation. Its touch can poison a human; in a magical spell, it invokes powers of death, damage and illusion.
1002134	Spider's silk is an inexpensive reagent, as it is quite plentiful and light on one's back, even in large quantities. However, it is so fine that massive amounts of fibers are consumed by a single spell. True to its origin as webbing, this reagent calls forth summoning and binding spells.
1002135	Foul smelling but powerful, sulphurous ash is a dusty volcanic residue. It is found mainly in Britannia's mountainous regions and is a common element of any spell releasing fire, light, or explosive energy.
1002136	Remove Trap
1002137	The skilled rogue will be able to disarm traps using the Remove Trap skill. In order to begin learning the art of removing traps you must first demonstrate proficiency at Lockpicking, and Detect Hidden. You must have a base level of 50 skill in both of those skills before you can begin your training in this area. To use the Remove Trap skill, simply use the skill from the skill list, and target the item that you wish to disarm. If you are successful in your attempt, you will disarm the trap. Failure to disarm the trap stands the possibility of setting off the trap. The higher your skill level, the more difficult the trap you can disarm. You must be very careful when using this skill, it can be quite a risky proposition. To disarm traps, you must be quite nimble, and will find that wearing gloves makes this process much more difficult.
1002138	Snooping
1002139	The Snooping skill is used to see into another player's backpack. To use the snooping skill, simply double click on another player's pack, and if you are successful, the pack will appear open to you on the screen. Be warned however that a large majority of players do not care for a player who frequents the use of this skill. This skill is best used in conjunction with stealing. To steal from other players, you must be a member of the thief's guild.
1002140	Spirit Speak
1002141	Spirit Speak is used to be able to understand the speech of ghosts. If you do not have this skill you will only be able to see a series of "oooooo"s emanating from the deceased. To use this skill, simply use the skill from the skill list, and if you are successful you will be able to understand the ghost. Keep in mind that the length of time the interpretation lasts is directly related to the level of skill you have attained and your level of intelligence.
1002142	Stealing
1002143	The skilled Pickpocket may be able to steal items in several manners, from a variety of sources. You may be able to steal from monsters, chests, NPC's, or other players (if you are a member of the thieves guild, or if they are an opponent in a guild war). You can attempt to steal in two ways. First, use the skill from your skill list, and target the container, creature, NPC, or player. This is a 'random steal' and will attempt to steal an item at random from this source. The second method is to first 'snoop' the container using your snooping skill, and then select a specific object to steal. Dragging this item into your inventory will check your stealing skill to determine your chances of success. The skilled pickpocket must be very dexterous in his or her work, and will find that the more armor you are wearing, the harder it will be to steal.
1002144	There are four possible outcomes to stealing:
1002145	-  True Success: you get the item and are not noticed
1002146	-  Partial Success: you get the item, but are noticed
1002147	-  Partial Failure: you do not get the item, but are not noticed
1002148	-  Total failure: you do not get the item, and your attempt is noticed
1002149	If your attempt is noticed, the guards can be called on you, so you must be very careful when attempting these practices. It is also important to note that for two minutes after stealing, the member of the Thieves' Guild is freely attackable by anyone in the area. In towns, the proscription against starting fights still applies, so even Thieves' Guild members will be safe from random attack, even if everyone knows of their affiliation.
1002150	As mentioned above, you will not be able to steal from other players unless you are a member of the thieves guild, or unless the target is an opponent in a guild war. You can join the thieves guild in the usual manner, by finding a Thief Guildmaster and asking him to join. There will be an entrance fee, and there are several entrance requirements. Your character must have adventured in the world for at least one week, must not have any murders to his name, and must have already demonstrated proficiency in stealing (60 skill minimum). The requirements to stay in the guild are stringent as well. If you are reported for murder, you will be summarily ejected from the guild, and cannot rejoin for one week. Also, once you join the guild, you cannot leave for one week, unless ejected from the guild. Thieves Guild members cannot report murders, and thus could be considered "freely" attackable anywhere in the world (except in justice regions, unless they steal from another player).
1002151	Swordsmanship
1002152	Swordsmanship is a melee combat skill, which allows for a strong-arm attack style of fighting.  A swordsperson is capable of using an axe, a battle axe, a double axe, an executioner's axe, a hatchet, a large battle axe, a pickaxe, a two-handed axe, a butcher knife, a cleaver, a skinning knife, a bardiche, a halberd, a broad sword, a cutlass, a katana, a longsword, a scimitar, or a viking sword in combat to slice there opponents to ribbons.
1002153	Only the one-handed weapons of a swordsman can be poisoned.  You must be careful when using a poison weapon, as the poison will damage the weapon and make it more likely to break.
1002154	Swordsmanship, like the other melee combat skills, requires that you have the appropriate weapon equipped.  Once you have the appropriate weapon equipped, you will need to enter war mode.  You will need to double-click on an opponent to attack them.
1002155	Tailoring
1002156	Use of the tailoring skill will allow you to make a wide variety of items, ranging from bandages to clothing, and even leather armor. Your raw materials can come from a variety of sources, from hunting animals for leather, to gathering cotton and spinning thread. You can also purchase materials from a vendor and craft them into items for resale.
1002157	To get leather from a cow, you will need to kill it and skin it.  In order to skin the cow, use a bladed weapon on the carcass.  This will leave hides on the corpse.  You may also get hides from other animals.
1002158	You may purchase cloth, or you may also find cotton lying in fields.  If you do find cotton, you may use the cotton.  This will bring up a targeting cursor.  Select a spinning wheel to use the cotton on and it will produce cloth.
1002159	Once you have your raw materials, you can make a wide variety of items. You need a sewing kit to tailor these items. A sewing kit can be purchased from a tailor.  Use the sewing kit with the materials in your pack. You will be given a window presenting the categories and items that you can craft with your skill level and materials. Choose the item you wish to make, and target the material if necessary. If you are successful, the item will be placed in your pack. If you do not have room in your pack, you will be unable to create the item. As your skill level rises, you will be able to make more complex items, and your chances for success will increase. After creating some items, you may wish to dye them to increase their appeal. You can do this by purchasing a dye tub, and some dyes. Just double click the dyes and select the tub you wish to use them on, then select the color you wish the tub to be. You can then dye items by double clicking the tub, and targeting the item you wish to dye.
1002160	Taste ID
1002161	Use of Taste Identification will allow you to determine the sort of potion you have in your possession, or to determine if an object is poisoned or not. Simply use the skill from the jewel on your skill list, and then target the item you wish to taste. If successful, you will be told what kind of potion it is (if the object is a potion) or whether or not it's poisoned (if it's not a potion).
1002162	Tinkering
1002163	The tinkering skill is used to make tools for other professions, and also to make clocks, sextants, and to trap containers. With this skill you can make hammers, tongs, scissors, smoothing planes, and numerous other tools. To make these tools and assorted items you will need a set of tinker's tools. First double-click on the tinker's tools, and then select your supply of metal or wood. A window will open displaying the items that you can make from the raw materials available (either wood or metal). You will need ingots for metal and boards for wood.  Some additional items may be necessary, such as gems for rings.
1002164	To place a trap on a container you must have a chest or other container, a poison potion, explosive potion, or crossbow bolt, and a small supply of metal. Use your tinker tools, then target your metal, and choose the type of trap you wish to make. Last, target the container you wish to trap. If successful, the container will become trapped, and the trap you have created will affect the next person who illegally opens this item. Using the proper key on this container will bypass the trap and allow you to open the chest safely. The strength of your trap will be directly related to your skill as a tinker.
1002165	Tracking
1002166	The tracking skill will allow you to track animals, monsters, and people. Use the skill by clicking the jewel on your skill list. You will be presented with a window, which will allow you to choose what you wish to track. Double-click the category you wish to track (animal, human, or monster), and you will be presented with a second window listing the specific PCs or NPC's that you can track. If you are successful, and an appropriate creature can be tracked, you will be told in what direction that creature can be found. The higher your skill level in tracking, the more likely you are to successfully track an object, and the farther you will be able to track it.
1002167	Veterinary
1002168	The veterinary skill will allow you to heal animals in much the same way that the healing skill works on people. To use the skill, simply double-click on a bandage, you will receive a targeting cursor, and then target the animal you wish to heal. The amount of healing that you provide will be based on your skill level.
1002169	Wrestling
1002170	This skill is used while in hand-to-hand combat (no weapon equipped). It is checked automatically when you fight, and may determine the frequency, and damage level with which you will strike your opponent. 
1002171	The wrestling skill has several uses in combat and may even be used to stun opponents.  If you do not have a weapon equipped and you attack a creature, your wrestling skill will come into play.

1011020	Many people in town can improve your skills. To find out if I can improve skills you are interested in simply walk up to me and say 'TRAIN'. I will give you a list of the skills that I'm proficient in. To choose the skill you want to train in, say 'TRAIN' and the name of the skill you'd like to be trained in, and I will tell you the cost. Drag the gold from your backpack and drop it onto me, and your skill will be increased. If you don't have enough for the full payment, you can pay less but your training won't be as complete and you won't gain as much skill as you could if you paid the full amount. The amount of skill that can be raised is dependant on the ability of the teacher, so it is best to seek out Grand Masters when trying to learn the most about a particular skill. Remember that there is an overall limit to the amount of skills that you can learn, so you may not want to try to learn all of the skills in this manner.

1011038	Hello. I am a shopkeeper. If you would like to buy or sell any items, then simply find a shopkeeper and say to them 'VENDOR BUY' in order to see the list of items they sell, or 'VENDOR SELL' in order to see if they're interested in buying anything you own. If you do have any items in your pack that a vendor is interested in purchasing, saying 'VENDOR SELL' will cause him to look through your pack and show you a list of the items he's interested in, as well as what he'll pay for each item. If he's not interested in anything you possess, he will let you know that as well. To purchase an item, simply look through the list that appears when you say 'VENDOR BUY' and select any item you can afford. It will appear at the bottom of your list, along with a running total of your current purchases.

1011448	The followers of Minax have taken control in the old lands, and intend to hold it for as long as they can. Allying themselves with orcs, headless, gazers, trolls, and other beasts, they seek revenge against Lord British, for slights both real and imagined, though some of the followers wish only to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting populace.
1011449	The council of Mages have their roots in the city of Moonglow, where they once convened. They began as a small movement, dedicated to calling forth the Stranger, who saved the lands once before.  A series of war and murders and misbegotten trials by those loyal to Lord British has caused the group to take up the banner of war.
1011450	True Britannians are loyal to the throne of Lord British. They refuse to give up their homelands to the vile Minax, and detest the Shadowlords for their evil ways. In addition, the Council of Mages threatens the existence of their ruler, and as such they have armed themselves, and prepare for war with all.
1011451	The Shadow Lords are a faction that has sprung up within the ranks of Minax. Comprised mostly of undead and those who would seek to be necromancers, they pose a threat to both the sides of good and evil. Their plans have disrupted the hold Minax has over Felucca, and their ultimate goal is to destroy all life.
1011452	This city is not controlled by any faction.
1011453	This city is controlled by Minax.
1011454	This city is controlled by Lord British.
1011455	This city is controlled by the Council of Mages.

1014000	A goodly carpenter lives not far from the market square before the castle gate.
1014001	A quite well-appointed provisioner's exists East of the river, just North of the Lighthouse.
1014002	Ah, 'tis a terrible thing, but the graveyard far to the south has become infested with the living bones of the dead.
1014003	An inn called Sweet Dreams lies next to the Main Gate, just East of the healer's shop.
1014004	Blackthorn stays out of sight mostly, sequestered in his castle up North of Britain.
1014005	Blackthorn's castle is on an island in the middle of a lake North of Britain.
1014006	Britain is bounded by two rivers. The Narrows is on the west and Brittany River on the east.
1014007	Despite its name, the Sweet Dreams inn is quite good. It is near the Main Gate.
1014008	He liveth here, in Britain, in his castle.
1014009	I know naught of thieves!
1014010	If there be one thing Britain is not lacking, it be inns!
1014011	If there's not a mapmaker to be found at the Oaken Oar, then I can't help thee much.
1014012	LB? Mayhap thou means Lord British ....
1014013	Long ago the Narrows were dug up to meet the moat, and now 'tis fed from the water of Brittany Bay.
1014014	Lord British supports the arts. There is a public theatre across from the Bardic Conservatory.
1014015	Narrows Neck is the name for the river mouth on the southwestern side of Britain.
1014016	That is the name of the old gate beside the castle moat, for once the poor came in through there to go to market. It is quite narrow.
1014017	That's the river that runs down the middle of the city.
1014018	The alchemist can be found with the mages in the the magic shop in front of the Main Gate.
1014019	The ankh in the temple is capable of restoring life to the dead. 'Tis in northern part of town, beside the river.
1014020	The blacksmith North of the Miner's Guild can probably sell thee anything thou might need.
1014021	The Blue Boar is just North of the library, on the river.
1014022	The butcher can be found between the docks, near the customs house.
1014023	The Cat's Lair is a bit disreputable, as it lies near the docks, but its beer is good.
1014024	The center of the musical arts in Britain is the Bardic Conservatory on the north side of town.
1014025	The city's sole veterinarian lives by the river, by the Mage's Bridge.
1014026	The Customs office checks imported goods. 'Tis on the waterfront.
1014027	The farms in this area are all in the countryside, to the west of Lord British's castle. Thou must cross the Narrows and follow the road there.
1014028	The First Bank of Britain lies next to the jeweler's, beside the moat.
1014029	The guildhall of the Mechanicians, or the Tinkers as some call them, is right beside Poor Gate.
1014030	The Mage Tower is the building with all the arches, made of grey stone, on the north side of the town.
1014031	The Main Gate divides the central city from the waterfront.
1014032	The Northside Inn is situated on the lake that surrounds Blackthorn's Castle.
1014033	The Oaken Oar houses excellent shipwrights. It is on the waterfront by the mouth of the Narrow Neck.
1014034	The ocean is to the south of Britain.
1014035	The Salty Dog is a tavern overlooking the park, right next to The Wayfarer's Inn.
1014036	The Warrior's Guild is housed in the Old Keep.
1014037	The waterfront is what many call everything south of the old city wall. Properly speaking, it runneth along the river from River's Gate Bridge, down along the water to the Oaken Oar and the Narrows.
1014038	The Wayfarer's Inn is beside the Mage's Gate, on the East side of the river.
1014039	The weapons trainer? Ah, that is on the north edge of town, on the eastern bank of the river. 'Tis called the Cavalry Guild.
1014040	There are many guilds in this city. 'Tis the benefit of living in Lord British's capital.
1014041	There are two gates in the old city walls. The Poor Gate, and the Main Gate are the names.
1014042	There are two guardhouses. One near the Gung-Farmer's Bridge, and the other next to Virtue's Pass.
1014043	There be a guildhall for the artisans of the town outside the old walls, south of the Armorer's.
1014044	There is a blacksmith beside the castle moat on the northern edge of town.
1014045	There is a healer on the market square, near the Main Gate.
1014046	There is a jeweler's just to the South of the Artist's guild.
1014047	There is a leatherworker's shop facing the market square.
1014048	There is a Mining Guild beside the city library.
1014049	There is a plague of orcs on the western side of the farms--if thou seekest their encampments, that is the place to look.
1014050	There is an armourer's shop beside the Mage Gate. Just South of the old city wall.
1014051	There's a baker on the market square before the castle gate.
1014052	Thou canst buy weapons at the blacksmith's shop.
1014053	Thou canst purchase clothes on the East side of the river, near the Cypress Bridge.
1014054	Thou canst see that the old city walls are of a different vintage stone than the castle proper. 'Twas built before the current castle buildings.
1014055	'Tis an expensive place, but the Unicorn Horn, overlooking the ocean on the east side, serves a decent ale.
1014056	'Tis being repaired, but it stands on the promontory o'erlooking Brittany Bay.
1014057	'Tis the bay on our southern coast.
1014058	Try the bowyer just East of the theatre.
1014059	Try the stables beside the Mage Tower.
1014060	Which sort of smith? Weaponsmith, blacksmith?
1014061	Blackthorn's castle is on an island in the middle of a lake North of Britain.
1014062	Incantations and Enchantments is in the middle of eastern Britain, on the south side of the park.
1014063	There are many bridges across the Brittany. There's the Great Northern Bridge at the north-most end, the Mage's Bridge, then the one we call Virtue's Pass. South of that there's Cypress Bridge, and the River's Gate Bridge. And, of course, the Gung-Farmer's Bridge connects Britain with the farmlands to the West.
1014064	The bridge next to the Mage's tower is thus called the Mage's Bridge.
1014065	The Cypress Bridge is surrounded on one side by a tailor's shop and on the other by a magic shop.
1014066	The Great Northern Bridge is so called because it's the Northern-most bridge in Britain.
1014067	The Gung-Farmer's Bridge connects all the farms with Britain proper.
1014068	The Southernmost bridge is called River's Gate.
1014069	There are three or four merchants of the arcane in Britain.
1014070	There's the Salty Dog, The Unicorn's Horn, The Cat's Lair, and The Blue Boar taverns, here in Britain.
1014071	Thou art in Britain.
1014072	Thou can find the Ethral Goods Magic Shop just south of the Main Gate. Next to the Premier Provisioner's shop.
1014073	Thou can get to the Sage Advice Magic Shop on the east side of the river.
1014074	Thou can purchase arcane goods at the Sorcerer's Delight - which some call the Mage Tower. It can be found in northern Britain, next to the Conservatory of Music.
1014075	Thou can work on thy swordplay at the old keep, south of Lord British's castle.
1014076	Ah, the weather... 'Tis an interesting thing, really. No matter what the season, no matter what enchantments are cast, our land is almost always blessed with clear and beautiful blue skies.
1014077	Bedrolls can be purchased from a provisioner.
1014078	Britanny Bay is the body of water on the edge of Britannia's capital.
1014079	Certainly, thou art welcome.
1014080	Cove? Thou shouldst find it North and East of Britain.
1014081	Dupre? Ah, yes, Lord British's friend and ally, I believe. If thou wert to search for him, I wouldst most recommend a tavern.
1014082	Excellent. 'Tis my lucky day.
1014083	Farewell.
1014084	Goodbye.
1014085	Greetings.
1014086	Hello.
1014087	Here.  In Town.
1014088	I accept.
1014089	I am well.
1014090	I cannot help thee.
1014091	I cannot speak but fondly on my homeland. Yet I would not forgo an opportunity to see other lands.
1014092	I can't take it. Sorry.
1014093	I don't want it. Sorry.
1014094	I have heard that the great dungeons sometimes have great treasures.
1014095	I know not of which thou doth speak.
1014096	I live here in _Town_.
1014097	I live in the town that thou art standing in.
1014098	I really don't need it.
1014099	I shall accept with pleasure.
1014100	I shall be happy to take it!  Thank thee!
1014101	I will take it, then.
1014102	I work here in town.
1014103	I work in the town that thou art in.
1014104	I would not live in Buccaneer's Den if I were thee, for it is home to the most vile men and women to sail the seas.
1014105	If thou art able to hunt the wild animals, sometimes thou can sell the meat that thou dost carve from them to a butcher.
1014106	If thou art wanting a respite from the rigors of Britannia, then thou can make a camp or check in to an Inn, whichever is the most convenient.
1014107	If thou can get an axe, perhaps thou could cut some trees into useful boards for woodworkers. They may be willing to pay thee for them.
1014108	If thou dost happen upon some ore, go to the blacksmith's shop and try to craft some armor or weapons. I have heard that it just takes practice.
1014109	If thou dost want to earn money, practice a skill. Make things and sell them to the public. Most shopkeepers will let thee use the tools and materials that they aren't using.
1014110	I'm doing relatively well.
1014111	Iolo? Ah, yes, Lord British's friend and ally, I believe.
1014112	It's essential to have good kindling and a bedroll if thou dost want to camp.
1014113	I've been needing one of these.
1014114	I've heard that Lord Blackthorn has written a couple of books describing his philosophies in-depth. If thou dost find these, I imagine thou wouldst be able to say better than I what Blackthorn is about.
1014115	Just fine.
1014116	Let's see... I remember the names of Shame, Wrong, Despise, and Hythloth. I've never owned a map of Britannia myself.
1014117	Lord Blackthorn wishes the freedom of choice in ALL things extended to everyone. Some say that he'd even sees the Orcs and Lizardmen as equals to the humans in Britannia.
1014118	Lord Shamino? Ah, yes, Lord British's friend and ally, I believe.
1014119	Not a problem.
1014120	Only the bravest knights belong to the Order of the Silver Serpent. 'Twas they who defeated the forces of Lord Robere.
1014121	Our moons are called Trammel and Felucca. They control the moongates.
1014122	Please back away a bit.
1014123	Please, keep it. I don't want it.
1014124	Right here.
1014125	Shrines to the virtues are spread around our land. I've heard that they can even resurrect the dead.
1014126	Tanners will buy hides and pelts that thou dost take from the animals thou dost hunt.
1014127	Thank thee!
1014128	Thank thee, but I don't want it.
1014129	Thank thee. Don't need any.
1014130	The moongates? They are... doors to different parts of Britannia. Except the destinations of the doors change with the phases of the two moons.
1014131	The name is familiar to me... ah, yes -- I believe he is the infrequent guest of Lord British. Mayhaps thou wilt find him sampling the local spirits.
1014132	There are many as yet unmapped places beneath Britannia. 'Tis rumored to be riches and magic in them. And creatures that will rend the flesh from thy bones.
1014133	This will come in handy indeed.
1014134	Thou art most kind!
1014135	Thou art most kind, but it isn't anything that I need.
1014136	Thou art nearer to me than I like.
1014137	Thou can find a good deal of treasure under Britannia. Look to the caves and what thou call dungeons.
1014138	Thou can sell feathers from birds to a bowyer. And a cook may purchase the bird itself from thee.
1014139	Thou shouldst be able to get kindling from any wood thou finds. If thou has an axe, of course.
1014140	Thou shouldst learn to use the moongates if thou dost plan to travel far. The key is in the phases of the moons.
1014141	Though a kind and generous man in his youth, Lord Robere thirsted for power in his later years, so legends say.  Had not the Order of the Silver Serpent been ready to fight for Lord British, this very land could have belonged to the ambitious conqueror.
1014142	Thou'rt welcome.
1014143	Tis the bay that touches the city of Britain.
1014144	Tis very generous of thee, but I don't need it.
1014145	Tis very generous of thee.
1014146	Various issues surface from time to time, such as taxation, invasion, protection form creatures of the wild.
1014147	Vesper? 'Tis a city in northeastern Britannia. Ore from the mines of Minoc are sent down river to be unloaded in Vesper.
1014148	Well, well, what have we here?
1014149	Why standest thou so near to me?
1014150	Wilt thou stand back a bit
1014151	Aye, we have a tanner. He's in the center o' town.
1014152	Britain thou'rt askin' about? I'm told 'tis the biggest city in the land. Don't see what all t'fuss is about. The size of hereabouts is plenty big for me.
1014153	Britain? 'Tis the capital of the whole wide world, o'course. Sits on the shore of Britanny Bay way off yonder.
1014154	Healing shrines are found all about Britannia.
1014155	I know nothing of any avatar.
1014156	I may have heard a legend of a city called Wind. It was in the mountains, if I recall.
1014157	If thou'rt looking for Trinsic, 'tis south, but along the eastern coast.
1014158	I've never seen Lord British myself.
1014159	Jhelom? 'Tis to be found at the very most northern tip of the largest Valarian Isles.
1014160	Nujel'm is an island city. Part of Britannia, but ... different.
1014161	Ocllo ... hmmm. 'Tis an island, I believe.
1014162	Our healer sets to the east side, between the two bridges. If thou seest the inn, thou hast gone too far north.
1014163	Our inn is up past the northern bridge.
1014164	Right beside the woodworker and blacksmith, thou'lt find our bathhouse.
1014165	Skara Brae? Thou canst not get more west than that!
1014166	The blacksmith is to the northwest, past the bath house.
1014167	The provisioner is southmost in town.
1014168	The tanner set up shop south of the healer.
1014169	The taverns are south, west of the provisioner.
1014170	The woodworker is next to the blacksmith.
1014171	Thou'rt in Buccaneer's Den.
1014172	Trinsic? 'Tis near the Cape of Heroes, I think.
1014173	Verity Isle is Moonglow's whereabouts. The island is named so for the city puts much store in lofty intellectual pursuits.
1014174	Vesper can be found on the eastern coast of Britannia, to the north.
1014175	Yew ... ahh, that is near to Empath Abbey. That's the land from whence the best wine comes.
1014176	I know many virtuous people.
1014177	If thou'rt in need of medical attention, there is none better to visit than our healer on the southern side of our village.
1014178	Our armourer is a fine hand with metal and leather. Feel free to view his wares in his shop two or three doors north of the healer.
1014179	Our lighthouse stands proud and straight to the north of the village ... not even a long walk's distance.
1014180	The orcs are bolder here than they dare elsewhere. They come from the fort to the south.
1014181	The orcs live safe in their fortress to the south, and when they set out, we have no warning.
1014182	This is Cove, friend. Not as fancy as a big city town, but a good place, with good people.
1014183	We have a small dock. 'Tis on the north side of town, right on the water, o'course.
1014184	A bit of action, eh? The Dueling Pit is in the center of town, of course.
1014185	Cemetery? We've got one, sadly a necessity, and it's to the far west of town.
1014186	Docks? Why, there are no less than four docks in Jhelom. One to the east of the main town, and one to the south, another on our northernmost island, and one on our southernmost isle.
1014187	Food can be most easily purveyed from the small shop a bit north and east of the town's southern docks.
1014188	If thou art looking for Jhelom's inn, it is north of the main southern docks.
1014189	I'll not ask thy business at the Thieves' Guild. 'Tis just south of the Dueling Pit, beneath the Library.
1014190	I'm told our weapons shop is one of the best. It is west and south from the Dueling Pit.
1014191	In my opinion, we have a fine woodworker. I'd call his shop south-central, though 'tis a bit to the east.
1014192	Indeed, the Fighters' Guild is in Jhelom. In fact, there are two. One is at the northern edge of the town, just west of the blacksmith. One is the farthest building south.
1014193	Jhelom is any mercenary's second home. 'Tis no finer place for selling thy sword arm. While it's still attached, at least.
1014194	Last I saw, there was a mage's shop just north of the theater. That's on the southern isle, thou knowest.
1014195	Library? We've got one, friend, and it's just south of the Dueling Pit.
1014196	Lord British? Why, he's our ruler, of course!
1014197	Our tinker is north and east of the main isle's southern gate.
1014198	Ranches are on the north-most island.
1014199	Sure, every fighter is interested in armor. My favorite is the nearest building to the eastern gate. There's another, too, at the south end of town.
1014200	The baker is north of the Weapons shop, west of the Dueling Pit.
1014201	The best place to buy fish is found just east of the Dueling Pit.
1014202	The clothes shop is to the southwest of town, betwixt the jeweler and the Thieves' Guild.
1014203	The Fisher's Guild is the most southern thing in the town, friend.
1014204	The guard tower is south of the Dueling Pit, on the far side of the library.
1014205	The Healer? Why close on to the Dueling Pit, of course!
1014206	The shipwright is nearest the town's eastern docks, but south of the armourer.
1014207	The tailor? That shop is on the southern island. It's a small island, but still Jhelom, right enough.
1014208	The Theater is on the southern isle.
1014209	Thou canst find him to the west of town, past the clothier and the Thieves' Guild.
1014210	Thou wilt find a provisioner on the eastern side of the main town, midway between northmost and southmost.
1014211	Town Hall? Find the Dueling Pits, near the center of town, then head a few paces north and east.
1014212	Town tavern? 'Tis a grand place for ale and perhaps a brawl or two. I recommend it. Head east from the Dueling Pit, and when thou smellest fish, turn right.
1014213	We do have blacksmith shops, one north of the city, just west of Town Hall, and another to the south, near the southern docks.
1014214	We have two. One south of town, and one on the southern isle.
1014215	A fine tavern is located in the southeast section of the city, near the bakery.
1014216	A small island southeast of the main city, is where the council meets in the House of Parliament.
1014217	Above the magic shop located in the southern part of the city, the mage's guild has a lovely meeting hall.
1014218	Artists are rare in Magincia. We import most of our artwork. 'Tis too much work and effort to create it ourselves.
1014219	Magic doth provide a variety of conveniences. But 'tis more a variant of technology than the manipulation of ether, that keeps our houses clean without having to work at it.
1014220	Many a great speech hath been heard in the town square in the north of the city, beside the temple.
1014221	New Magincia? 'Tis nothing wrong with this fine city ... we do not need a new one.
1014222	Parliament doth consist of a nine member council. The retiring council member hath the responsibility of appointing their replacement.
1014223	The bakery is located on the southeastern tip of the main island before you cross the bridge to Parliament.
1014224	The best tailor is located next to the shipwrights on the far southwest side of the city.
1014225	The docks are located on the far south side of the city.
1014226	The fish market is located on the city's docks, on the south side.
1014227	The healer's hall is on the westernmost street in the city, toward the southern end, near the tailor's and the fish market.
1014228	The jeweler's shop is located on the far west side of the city, between the Miner's Guild Hall and the tailor's shop.
1014229	The local inn is located nearly in the exact centre of the city. A small park lies to the north of it.
1014230	The merchants meet in the building behind the fish market. 'Tis near the docks on the south side of the city.
1014231	The miner's guild is located on the western edge of town, behind the inn.
1014232	The people of Magincia are direct descendants of those who forged the world, and one day we will inherit the world, and make our way to the stars and take our place as the rulers of all the lands below. We have good cause to be proud.
1014233	The pirates of Buccaneer's Den resent our wealth, but hath begun to raid less and less often thanks to magical items of protection purchased from Moonglow.
1014234	The provisioner shares space with the fish market. 'Tis located on the city docks on the far south end of the city.
1014235	The shipwrights, why 'tis located on the south side of the city on the docks.
1014236	The temple is located near the beach to the far north, just east of the town square.
1014237	The tinker's shop is located just south of the steps leading toward the town square on the north end of town.
1014238	There's a warehouse that stocks all kinds of goods on the east side of the city near the tinker's shop.
1014239	Thou canst purchase magical goods in the southern end of the city along the central street.
1014240	Both Miners' Guild halls are near the center of town.
1014241	Dancing is a sport in Minoc. Sometimes the music is louder than the blacksmith's anvil next door.
1014242	I do not know of a place called 'Buccaneer's Den'.
1014243	Miners' tents are east and south of town. They stay close to the mines, mostly.
1014244	Minoc is about thee. There is not much north of here, friend.
1014245	Minoc is not so large a city that we must separate the homes from the businesses. Houses are throughout the town.
1014246	Our healer's shop is in the southeastern corner of town.
1014247	Soldiers and professional fighters all gather in their hall, which is near center of town, one door south of the tavern.
1014248	Supplies are a steady business in Minoc. We have a provisioner on both the north and south sides of town.
1014249	The butcher's shop is at the very northwest corner of Minoc.
1014250	The horses are kept a bit apart from the town. The stable is north, just northeast of the tavern.
1014251	The mines are due east of town.
1014252	The tavern is in the north part of town, near to the butcher and warriors' guild.
1014253	The woodworker has a good selection of material in these parts. The shop is on the east side of town, just a bit of wander north of the tanner.
1014254	Thou'lt find our tinker in the center of Minoc.
1014255	Thou'rt lookin' for the blacksmith? The smithy is on the far side of town from the stables.
1014256	We have but one tanner, and thou'lt find the shop south, but not so far as the provisioner.
1014257	We have two guilds: the Warriors' and the Miners'.
1014258	We think pretty highly of our armourer. His shop in the southeast corner of town has brisk business.
1014259	All manner of baked goods can be found just south of the docks.
1014260	Fine armour can be had from the armoury in the center of town. Look to the west of Moonglow, to one side of the street that leads west out of town.
1014261	Fresh fruit can be had at a humble store near the center of town. It is just south of the inn, if thou'rt interested.
1014262	If it were not for the zoo in southern Moonglow, the mages would have to trek into the wilds to view these humble creatures ... and grass stains make for angry apprentices.
1014263	If thou'rt looking for the town hall, look to the southwest corner of the heart of Moonglow.
1014264	Indeed, Moonglow has several Mages' Guilds. Three in fact. One to the south, one to the east and one to the north.
1014265	Master mages are usually professors at the Lycaeum. They can be found there, or in their homes, or sometimes about the streets of Moonglow. They are usually willing to answer questions.
1014266	Moonglow was founded by Lord British to be a research colony. The Lycaeum is where the research takes place. Nearly all new magic in Britain comes from that building on the northwest peninsula.
1014267	North of the Gadgeteers' Guild is a mage scholar who will teach travelers his lore, regardless of whether they attend the Lycaeum.
1014268	Our healer is in the central part of Moonglow, on the far western side. It is but two doors away from the teleporters, and that's a good thing, I promise.
1014269	Our tailor has a central location, just across the street from the provisioner.
1014270	Reagents are quite in demand in Moonglow. There is a store devoted to their sale, close by the teleporters.
1014271	Teleporters? Well, there's one near the Lycaeum, of course, one by the zoo, one near the eastern residence section, and one near the northern houses.
1014272	The artists live near their guildhall. If thou'rt interested in visiting Moonglow's bastion of the finer arts, look to the east of the main town area. The artists are close by where the road turns northward.
1014273	The best place in Moonglow to buy supplies would be at the provisioner's shop, just south of the docks.
1014274	The butcher is across the street from the herbalist. If thou'rt lost, both meat and herbs are to the west of the central teleporters.
1014275	The cemetery is found to the south of the city. It is a small one, but strikingly serene.
1014276	The docks are easy enough to get to ... they are north of the city proper, and in betwixt the two 'prongs' that extend north into the sea.
1014277	The Gadgeteers' Guild is in the heart of the city, to the southeast of the teleporters.
1014278	The herbalist is found but one door south of the shop of reagents. Theirs customers are similar, but their businesses do not conflict as often as thou might suspect.
1014279	The inn is east a ways from the docks, a bit south. If thou sees the Artists' Guild, thou art too far east. If thou finds the scholar mage's place, thou art too far south.
1014280	There is one apprentice for each Mages' Guild. Therefore, one is to be found near the northern Guild, one near the southern Guild, and one to the east.
1014281	Thou canst guess from our city's name that our scholars are intrigued by celestial objects. In the eastern part of the city, near the shore, we have the realms' largest eyeglass pointed at the sky.
1014282	Thou should stop and take a look at the woodcarver's wares. Thou'lt find the store just north and a bit west from the main teleporter location. The skill and detail work are, I think, second to none.
1014283	We are on Verity Isle. The island is named so for the city puts much store in lofty intellectual pursuits.
1014284	We have a mage who deals in potions and other such things. Look a bit south of the tailor, just to the northeast of the teleporters.
1014285	And why wouldst thou be needing a cemetery? Sure, thou'rt neither so old, nor so ill? Well, thou'lt find it to the far northwest, outside the city walls.
1014286	Aye, The Silver Bow. 'Tis a bit quieter than Mystical Spirits, I'll tell that that. 'Tis further from the casino than Mystical Spirits, just south of the concert hall. Draws a milder crowd.
1014287	Dost thou mean the gazebo? The little open-air wooden structure on the southeast side of town? 'Tis between The Silver Bow tavern and Restful Slumber inn.
1014288	If the idea of a human chessboard appeals to thee, thou'lt find ours at the southern end of the road through the center of town, past the town manor and the inn.
1014289	If thou seekst to buy or sell goods, most tradespeople keep shops in the mall at the far west end of town. If thou'rt merely hungry, thou canst get a good meal at The Silver Bow or Mystical Spirits.
1014290	If thou'rt in search of sustenance, thou'lt find two taverns in the east of town - Mystical Spirits and the Silver Bow.
1014291	If thou'rt looking to buy or sell something, there's a mall to the west of the city, where thou'lt find almost everything - blacksmith, boyer, weaponsmith, tanner, food and supplies.
1014292	Needst thou a tailor? Thou canst not find one better than ours ... Thou'lt find the shop along the eastern edge of town, next door to the Mystical Spirits tavern.
1014293	Our inn is called Restful Slumber, and 'tis fairly true to name. Thou'lt find it in the southeastern quarter of town, neighboring The Silver Bow tavern. I wish a pleasant stay.
1014294	Seek'st thou a gaming house? The try the casino in the northeast quarter, next door to the Mystical Spirits. I think thou'lt find Nujel'm lives up to her reputation.
1014295	So, 'tis the merchant's guild thou'lt be seeking? Art interested in trade in human flesh, then? For that's what thou'lt find there. 'Tis at the southern tip of town, next the jail.
1014296	The jeweler's shop is in the northeast corner of town, east of the conservatory and north of the casino.
1014297	There's but one bank in Nujel'm, and it lies in the southeastern quarter of town, not too far from the human chessboard.
1014298	Thou'lt find the customs house overlooking the northeast bay. 'Tis inside the city walls, next door to the concert hall.
1014299	Thou'lt find the jail near the merchant's guild, south of the human chessboard. I'd be wary if I wert thee - 'tis one thing to be on this side of the bars down there, but 'tis a nightmare on the other.
1014300	Thou'lt find the Mystical Spirits on the eastern edge of town, next door to the casino. But if thou permit me to say, I prefer The Silver Bow, which is just a few paces south of it. Better atmosphere.
1014301	Travelers from less civilized towns often mistake the large building in the center of town for a palace. But, 'tis merely a manor house, and the man who lords over it made his fortune here in Nujel'm.
1014302	We have both a renowned conservatory and concert hall. Thou'lt find both to the north of town, between the customs house and the casino.
1014303	Wilt thou hear sweet music? We have a beautiful concert hall in the north of the city, next door to the customs house. There's a conservatory for bards across the street, should you wish to study further.
1014304	All manner of clothing can be found on the mainland side. The tailor's shop is just west from the stables.
1014305	I've been pleased with our armourer's work. Look for the shop called 'Serpent's Arms', just east of the healer.
1014306	Our provisioner can set thee up with supplies. Look just to the north of the blacksmith.
1014307	'Serpent's Hold Meats' is on the shore of the mainland, east of the bridge.
1014308	Serpent's Hold, thou hast found, is on the largest island just east and south of the Cape of Heroes.
1014309	The blacksmith works in one of the large buildings central in the Hold. The smithy is the northernmost of the two.
1014310	The heart of Serpent's Hold is the Keep. It is the largest building on the island, in the northwest corner.
1014311	The inn is on the west side of the island, close to the main gate.
1014312	The stables are on the mainland side of Serpent's Hold, betwixt the tailor and the tinker.
1014313	The tavern faces the healer's shop, immediately on thy left as thou comes in over the bridge.
1014314	The tinker's place is on the mainland. Thou'lt find it closest to the bridge.
1014315	Thou'lt find the healer's place between the armoury and the tavern. 'Tis sometimes crowded, especially right after training.
1014316	Cartographer's are usually found sharing space with shipwrights.
1014317	Farmers come into town, but their crops are all a bit over on the mainland.
1014318	Just north of the healer is where our blacksmith keeps shop.
1014319	Not settling down, I take it. Thou'lt find the provisioner to the northwest of the inn.
1014320	Our fair city of Skara Brae is the central hub for all the westward sea expeditions.
1014321	Our healer is close to the east dock.
1014322	Our inn is at the south end of the isle, near the docks, o'course.
1014323	Our theatre is on the northern edge of town, just a bit north and east of the beekeeper.
1014324	The alchemist's shop is the very most northeast place in town.
1014325	The animal trainer sets up shop just north of the beekeeper. They are much the same thing, to my mind.
1014326	The armourer is toward the center of town, but off a bit to the north-west.
1014327	The beekeeper has a shop toward the north of town, just south of the theatre.
1014328	The bowyer is north and a little west of the inn. In my opinion, the work is excellent.
1014329	The butcher shop is in the midst of town, betwixt the tavern and the magic shop.
1014330	The clothier keeps his shop on the east shore, three doors north of the dock.
1014331	The rangers' guildhall is on the west side of the isle. 'Tis north of the tavern and Town Hall, y'know.
1014332	The tavern sits on the western shore. It is just north of Town Hall
1014333	There is a shop of gentle magics, and that's a fact. 'Tis very near the exact center of town.
1014334	This is fine country for growing food. Our farmers sell at a shop near the northern edge of town, toward the middle and just south of the theatre.
1014335	Thou hast a choice. There is one guild on the northwest side of town, and another just across the water to the east.
1014336	Town Hall, eh? Well, and I hope thou bring no trouble to our fair isle. Walk west and south to get there.
1014337	Weapons can be had from the shop in the north-east corner of town.
1014338	We've a fine shipwright, close on to the southernmost dock.
1014339	Woodcrafter? That shop is toward the north of town, center between the weaponsmith and the farmers' shop.
1014340	Any thieves or other such riffraff are incarcerated in the Constabulary, just north of the Traveler's Gate.
1014341	Fine gems are the trade of our master jeweler, who has set up shop on the south side of our commercial district, neighboring the baker and the healer.
1014342	If thou hast a mind to see a tinker, the shop is in the southern part of the city ... just follow the river up to where it enters the city, and thou'lt find the place.
1014343	If thou'rt looking for the Fishers' Guild, go to the farthest part of the city to the southeast. The guildhall is next to the fish market.
1014344	Our baker is in the southern part of the city, just to the south and east of the Traveler's Gate.
1014345	Our Engineers' Guild is in the northwest corner of town.
1014346	Our provisioner's shop is the first thing one sees coming into the city. 'Tis the large building to the south of the entrance gate.
1014347	The armour shop is north of the monastery and mayor's house. I think you'll be pleased with the selection.
1014348	The butcher's shop is in the southeast corner of Trinsic.
1014349	The Guild of Engineers meets in their hall in the northwest section of town.
1014350	The mayor lives in the north side of town, betwixt the armourer and the monastery.
1014351	The monastery is renowned for its serene gardens. 'Tis on thy left as thou comes into the city.
1014352	The paladins meet in their guildhall, found on the eastern side of their island.
1014353	The paladins who live in Trinsic call the barracks home. They are in the northern part of the eastern half of town.
1014354	The stables are just a pace to the west of the inn.
1014355	The tailor's shop is a bit apart from the others. It is a bit south and east of the river's fork.
1014356	The tavern is just west of the fork in the river.
1014357	There's a good weaponsmith in the center of town, just a few paces south of the Soldier's Gate.
1014358	There's a guild or two in Trinsic. The Fisher Guild is to the southeast, and the Engineer's Guild is to the northwest. The Paladins' Guild is on their island, of course.
1014359	Thou'rt in Trinsic, of course, near the Cape of Heroes we are.
1014360	Thou'rt looking to train? The training salle is just inside the Soldier's Gate.
1014361	To find the shrine, simply walk to the point most north and east of town. 'Tis close to the water.
1014362	We have a very fine mage indeed. Thou canst find him just north of the inn, above the Traveler's Gate.
1014363	We have but one healer, and too far a walk from the training grounds, to my mind. If thou hast wounds, look to the south of the commercial district.
1014364	We have guardhouses at most strategic locations: especially wall corners with good visibility.
1014365	We have two inns, one at the easternmost part of town, and one in the west, a bit to the north.
1014366	You can't get fish fresher than at our fish market. It is outside the city gates, on the sea side.
1014367	Customs is in the very southeast part of Vesper.
1014368	I can tell thee that our mage buys reagents from the reagent shop near the docks. The stuff comes from all over, and Vesper gets first pick-through.
1014369	I hope thou hast had no trouble in Vesper, friend. The town hall is a southern island, one door south of the warriors' guild.
1014370	If I knew there was a thieves guild, I'd tell the guards first!
1014371	If thou'rt in need of armour, look on the central westernmost island of Vesper.
1014372	If thou'rt looking for potions, the shop thou needest is to the far north of Vesper, on the same island as the Jeweler.
1014373	Lookin' for the Bards' Guild? 'Tis the southernmost building on the northernmost island of Vesper.
1014374	On a lazy afternoon I like to wander around in Vesper's museum. It is the large building east of the tanner.
1014375	On the centermost island, farthest to the east, thou canst find the Seaman's guild.
1014376	On the western shore, at the southern end of Vesper, is an inn. It is much the same as the inn on the south-central island.
1014377	Our bank is on the northmost island. Look for the jeweler and the painter's studio.
1014378	Our healer has trained with the best, friend, as will be more than able to ease thy suffering. Look on a small island, just one bridge east of the blacksmith, or one bridge south of the woodworker.
1014379	Our mortuary and crypts are on the western bank, north of the inn.
1014380	Our tinker's shop can be found on a central island, somewhat north.
1014381	The baker's place is on the island just north of the docks.
1014382	The bee hives are kept on a small islet at the northeast. 'Tis north of the butcher and baker, and east of the painter's studio.
1014383	The best artist's studio, and by coincidence the only one, is on the northern isle, near the guild houses.
1014384	The farmer brings his produce in from the fields and sells it from his shop on the island just north of the docks.
1014385	The jeweler keeps shop on the northern island, betwixt the miners' and bards' guild halls.
1014386	The shipwright is the nearest building to the docks, o'course!
1014387	The soldiers and fighters gather in their hall on the large southern island.
1014388	The tailor is on the eastern shore of the river. Take the bridge from the northern isle and then go south.
1014389	The tanner is one bridge away from shore, at the point farthest south of the city.
1014390	The tavern is on one of the southern islands, I believe toward the center. I see it when I run errands to the customs house.
1014391	The woodworker's shop can be found but one bridge north of the healer's island.
1014392	There are a fair number of sorcerers here, and that's a fact. They meet in the upper floors of their hall on the north island.
1014393	There are mages who will sell their talents, true enough. Merely look on the ground floor of their guildhall on the north island.
1014394	There is naught but fresh fish in Vesper, and 'tis easiest had from the fisherman's shop. Look near the baker and butcher's places.
1014395	There's a fine tailor's shop in Vesper. Look to the largest southern island, in the building just north of the warriors' guildhouse.
1014396	Thou might try one of the center islands, away to the west. Methinks I've seen a bowyer's sign hanging there.
1014397	Thou'lt be wanting supplies, I take it? The provisioner keeps a shop to the north of town, on the shore.
1014398	Thou'lt find the blacksmith on the largest of the southern isles.
1014399	Thou'lt find the Miners' Guildhouse on the northernmost island, just where the river breaks around Vesper.
1014400	Thou'rt looking for the butcher, I take it. Get thee to the docks, then take the bridge north from that island. The butcher is the first building thou'lt see.
1014401	Vesper, thou canst see, is on the eastern coast of Britannia, to the north.
1014402	Food is a necessity, but certainly nothing to waste time over. Our communal eating area is to the far east of Wind.
1014403	If thou needest a healer, look to the eastern central part of wind. 'Tis close by the food place, if thou knowest where that is, but farther south and west.
1014404	Inns are scattered throughout Wind. One is northwest, one is northeast, and one is south.
1014405	Labs are places of study and discovery. We've one to the northwest of Wind, and one to the east.
1014406	Lord British became ruler of the united realm of Britannia when he wrested control from the 'evil' Lord Robert. The stories that are mostly known are, of course, mostly apocryphal.
1014407	Lord British is the ruler of Britannia. He seems a kind and just king, trying to do the right thing for his people.
1014408	Magincia is an island city east of Britain. It is all pride and foolishness, for it has never known deprivation.
1014409	Minoc is in the northmost part of the realm, a bit to the east. It is in the mountains, and is economically dependent on the nearby ore mines.
1014410	Moonglow is on the southern tip of Verity isle, and is a very logical place. They buy other cities' technology and examine it to see how it works. Laudable.
1014411	Our libraries are filled with scholars grazing on information. Look to the center of Wind for our collected tomes of knowledge.
1014412	Our only supply of reagents are sold in the central part of Wind. Look close by the libraries, in the same general location of the healer.
1014413	Serpent's Hold is on the largest island just east and south of the Cape of Heroes. It is where all the fighters of Britannia are trained.
1014414	Skara Brae is on an island due west of Britain. They study a mental form of magic that is unusual for that part of the world.
1014415	Tailor made clothes and repairs thou canst find at the tailor's shop, east of the provisioner.
1014416	This is Wind, of course. We study all manner of things: magic, the world, the inexplicable self.
1014417	Thou canst purchase thy supplies from the provisioner, found south and west from the northwestern inn.
1014418	Yew is in the northwest region of Britannia. It is home to the Empath Abbey where the famous wine is made.
1014419	Fresh meat can be had from the butcher, in the clearing at the center of Yew.
1014420	Fresh vegetables and other nourishing foods are sold at the market in the center of town. Look for a shop close by the butcher and baker.
1014421	If thou hast grain to be milled, take it to the flour mill just a bit west of the Abbey.
1014422	If thou'rt handy with a bow and arrows, then surely thou'lt be interested in our bowyer's excellent work. Look in his shop at the center of town ... there a selection that'll make thy head spin.
1014423	It was decided a long time ago that local judges would sit on the High Court. If thou wishes to see the court, head west and north of town. I cannot say if there is a trial in progress, however.
1014424	The cemetery is to the south and east of town.
1014425	The healers in Yew are specialized in natural cures. There are at least two in town: one is southeast and one is central.
1014426	The monks in the abbey that lies to the northeast spend their time studying painting, sculpting, prose, poetry, music ... and wine.
1014427	The prison is past the High Court to the northwest ... although it is not a common tourist site. Usually people come here for the wine.
1014428	The vineyards and winery are just south of the abbey, to the east of the flour mill and across the little inlet.
1014429	There is a prison storehouse between the High Court and the prison.
1014430	We do have a baker, and a fine one at that. To find the bakery, find the market near the center of Yew. The baker hangs his sign between that of the butcher and the woodworker.
1014431	Yew is famous for its wood crafts. There is a woodwork shop near the bakery, just a bit south of the bowyer.
1014432	Yew, thou hast found, is in the northwest region of Britannia.
1014433	Dost thou need to improve thy alchemy? Sure, I might be able to teach thee.
1014434	I am an alchemist.
1014435	I train animals.
1014436	I am an architect.
1014437	I'm an armourer.
1014438	I've been known to teach some how to improve their skills, for a few coins.
1014439	I am an artist.
1014440	Yes, I'm the baker. How can I help thee?
1014441	I am a Banker.
1014442	I am a bard. A minstrel. A thoughtful troubadour.
1014443	Accept my apologies, for my lack of comprehension.
1014444	If 'twere in my capabilities to help thee, I surely would.
1014445	I cannot fathom what 'tis that thou wishest.
1014446	I'm a beekeeper.
1014447	I'm between jobs at the moment. But if thou couldst find it in thine heart to help out a soul in need, I'm sure that my luck will change!
1014448	I've been a smith for a good number of years.
1014449	I'm a bowyer by trade.
1014450	I am sort of like a porter. I lighten the burdens of rich travelers.
1014451	I am a butcher.
1014452	I'm the carpenter here.
1014453	I can give thee some practice in carpentry, all thou dost need do is to ask.  And leave me a few coins.
1014454	A Cashual is one who has a deep understanding of the practical applications of natural philosophy.
1014455	I can give thee some practice in our art, all thou dost need do is to ask.  And leave me a few coins.
1014456	I'm a cobbler.
1014457	Fare thee well.
1014458	Goodbye, stranger.
1014459	May the rest of thy day be pleasant.
1014460	Thou wishest to speak with me?
1014461	Thou hast mine attention.
1014462	What is it thou wishest?
1014463	I am listening to thee.
1014464	I am a cook and baker.
1014465	I've been known to teach some how to improve their cookin', for a few coins.
1014466	Pardon me?,
1014467	Excuse me?,
1014468	I do not understand.
1014469	I beg thee, do not harm me. I cannot help thee.
1014470	I do not understand thee--I am sure it must be my fault, however.
1014471	Begging thy pardon, but I fail to understand what it is that thou wantest.
1014472	I wish I could answer thee, so that thou wouldst leave me alone.
1014473	Excuse my incomprehension, oh mighty terrorizer of small children, but I did not understand thee, and would find life more pleasant without thy ilk nearby.
1014474	I am sorry, but I do not always understand the utterances of petty criminals.
1014475	Forgive me, but I do not understand.
1014476	Excuse me? Forgive my lack of comprehension.
1014477	If I look perplexed, 'tis because I am.
1014478	Accept my apologies, for my lack of comprehension.
1014479	If 'twere in my capabilities to help thee, I surely would.
1014480	I cannot fathom what 'tis that thou wishest.
1014481	Begging thy pardon, but in my awe at seeing thee actually here before me, I neglected to listen closely to what thou spoke.
1014482	Sadly, I must report that I know nothing of what thou speakest.
1014483	Help me to understand thee, for I know not what thou seekest.
1014484	I am a simple farmer. I raise crops.
1014485	I am paid to fight!,
1014486	I've been known to teach a select few how to improve their fighting, for a few coins.
1014487	I am a fisherman.
1014488	I can give thee some fishing tips, all thou dost need do is to ask.  And I do expect to be paid for my time.
1014489	My trade is selling pelts of all sorts.
1014490	I can teach thee about the animals in the forest and how to know more about them, if thou art willing.
1014491	I'm a gamer by trade.  The cards and dice are my partners.
1014492	I could show thee a few things that the local guard wouldn't much take to, I'm sure.
1014493	I'm a glassblower.
1014494	Greetings.  What might I do for thee?,
1014495	Greetings.  What might I help thee with?,
1014496	Yes?,
1014497	Hello, my friend!  How may I assist thee?,
1014498	Hello!
1014499	I am a guard.
1014500	I'm a wanderer, and take whatever fortune offers me.
1014501	If thou dost want to learn, I might be persuaded to teach thee about such things as camping in the wild. Or not being seen when thou dost not WANT to be seen. Thou wouldst need to pay me, thou knowest.
1014502	I am one of the many healers of Britannia. I also sell potions and healing scrolls.
1014503	If thou dost want to learn, I might be persuaded to teach thee about first aid. I could teach thee, also, about the human anatomy. Thou wouldst need to pay me, of course.
1014504	I sell many fragrant dried herbs and flowers.
1014505	If thou dost want to learn, I might be persuaded to teach thee some alchemy skills. Thou wouldst need to pay me, of course.
1014506	I have some horses here that I could sell to thee.
1014507	I am an innkeeper.
1014508	I am an innkeeper.
1014509	Thy nearness offends me.
1014510	Stand back, I do not wish to be seen so near to thee.
1014511	I'm the jailkeeper.
1014512	I'm a maker of fine jewelry.
1014513	I'm a judge of the High Court of Britannia.
1014514	I am a laborer, and working is how I spend my days.
1014515	I am a wizard, a weaver of spells.
1014516	If thou dost need help with thy magic, just ask me to teach thee and I will. For a small price.
1014517	I am a mapmaker. Wouldst thou like to learn to make maps? In theory, 'tis simple - find a blank map, go to the spot thou wouldst map, and map it. In practice, of course, this requires a bit of skill ...
1014518	If thou dost need help with thy mapmaking, just ask me to teach thee and if I can, I will.
1014519	If thou hast guild business, thou may bring it to me. I am the guildmaster.
1014520	I'm the mayor, friend. Welcome to our fair city!,
1014521	I am a miller.
1014522	I work in the mines.
1014523	I am a minter.
1014524	I'm a brother at Empath Abbey.
1014525	I'm doing well enough, now.
1014526	Things seem to be going well.
1014527	No no no, a job is for those who lack money!  Nobility doesn't take jobs.
1014528	I'm the pit overseer.
1014529	I am a Paladin of Britannia!,
1014530	I am a member of Parliament.
1014531	I live on the sea.  'Tis no job, but a life!,
1014532	I am a humble servant of the Gods.
1014533	I'm a prisoner!  Can't thou see that?,
1014534	I sell general provisions.
1014535	I'm a cattle rancher.
1014536	I am a ranger. I spend most of my days in the woods, observing and tracking animals. I hunt that I may eat, and try to live in harmony with the land.
1014537	Tracking is more of an art than a science, but it begins with a thorough knowledge of the traits and habits of the creature being tracked. I can help thee with that, I think.
1014538	I am the realtor for this town. If thou desires a domicile of thy own, I can help thee.
1014539	And hello again. How may I help thee, _Name_?
1014540	And hello to thee, again.
1014541	I am a message carrier.  Pardon me, I need to be running.
1014542	I'm a sailor, my friend!,
1014543	Ah, this will be useful.
1014544	Excellent. 'Tis my lucky day.
1014545	I've been needing one of these.
1014546	This will come in handy indeed.
1014547	Well, look what I found!
1014548	I study ancient times and ancient tomes.
1014549	I'm a humble scrivener.
1014550	I'm a sculptor.
1014551	I serve the needs of Magincian nobles.
1014552	I tend to the sheep and keep them safe.
1014553	I'm a shipwright.
1014554	I am a _Job_.  What wouldst thou expect me to sell?,
1014555	If thou art interested in selling an item to me, then thou must give it to me and I'll decide if I need it in my stock. Otherwise, thou can buy anything that I sell here.
1014556	I'm a tailor.
1014557	I am sure I can break my busy schedule to lend thee some instruction, assuming thou hast some coin.
1014558	I am a tanner in this fine town.
1014559	I'm the tavernkeeper here.
1014560	I'm the tavernkeeper here.
1014561	Aye. I have been called thief, rogue and rapscallion and some things far worse, as I am sure thou hast been. Let us not say that again for others might hear and recognize us.
1014562	I'm a tinker.
1014563	It will take a steady hand and a sure eye to be a tinker. If thou art willing to learn, then I can help thee.
1014564	Why I am a veterinarian.
1014565	I serve food.
1014566	I am one of the many wandering healers of Britannia.
1014567	If thou dost need help with first aid, just ask me to teach thee and if I can, I will. For a small price.
1014568	I'm a smith.
1014569	I am a weapons trainer.
1014570	I'm a weaver.

1043265	Soon I shall be free of this employment.
1043266	My loyalty hath eroded, for lack of pay.
1043267	My term of service is ending, unless I be paid more.

1046044	For some time now, our hunters have been disappearing in the forests of this island.
1046045	We believe vile 'Shadow Wisps' are responsible for these disappearances.
1046046	Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Shadow Wisps'. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.
1046047	Well done! You have completed your task of slaying the 'Shadow Wisps'.
1046048	Return to Uzeraan and tell him of your findings.  He is no doubt eagerly awaiting your return.
1046049	Return to Uzeraan and tell him of your findings.
1046050	Uzeraan gives you a somber look and begins to speak slowly:
1046051	You bring sad news stranger and I fear our men may be lost forever. They will be mourned.
1046052	You, however, have shown great Valor in your battle against the wretched 'Shadow Wisps'. I am pleased.
1046053	For your efforts I have placed a small token of my appreciation in your backpack.
1046054	Unfortunately, I have more disturbing news. We once had an underground cavern that we used for mining ore.
1046055	It seems horrible creatures have been emerging from the caves at night, terrorizing the villagers.
1046056	In their folly, a mob of frightened villagers collapsed the entrance to the mining cave.
1046057	The villagers did not know that I had recently installed a teleporter in the cave.  It was designed to give the workers a quick way to return home from the cave.
1046058	What's worse is that this teleporter only goes one way: Out of the cave, into our village.
1046059	The horrid phantasms still haunt us on a nightly basis using MY teleporter to get here. We have no way to get into the cave!
1046060	Well - there is one way. Let me tell you something of magic travel...
1046061	MAGIC TRAVEL:
1046062	To begin with, you need what is called a recall rune.  Blank recall runes can be purchased at most any magic supply shop.
1046063	Then, you need either in your spellbook, or inscribed on a scroll a 'Mark' spell. 'Tis a spell of the 6th circle.
1046064	You then cast the Mark spell and target the recall rune. This inscribes the rune with the location at which you are standing.
1046065	To instantly return to the location where the rune was marked, you employ the 'Recall' spell.
1046066	This spell is of the 4th circle and you should have little trouble with it.
1046067	Simply cast the Recall spell and target the marked recall rune of the location you wish to travel to.
1046068	There is also another, called 'Gate Travel' which operates on the same principles as the Recall spell.
1046069	Gate Travel allows you to open a magical gate to the location of your marked recall rune. This way, others can travel with you.
1046070	Gate Travel is of the 7th circle however, and you will not be able to weave such intricate magic for a while.
1046071	Now - to get back to the subject at hand.  Whilst I was working in the caves, installing the teleporter, I marked a rune.
1046072	This would, in theory, allow us to travel into the cave to investigate the condition of our mining resources.
1046073	Unfortunately, to cast any spell, one must have the necessary reagents. Reagents that I do not have.
1046074	My supply of Mandrake Root has run dry and so I cannot cast any of the magic travel spells needed to enter the cave.
1046075	I must ask of you to go and gather Mandrake Root for me.  Try the reagent shops if you have money, or find another way if you do not.
1046076	I have no money for reagents to give you at this time, but be assured that I will repay you.
1046077	Please hurry - time is short and so is our supply of fighters to fend off the wicked creatures.
1046078	Uzeraan nods at you with approval and begins to speak:
1046079	Thank you stranger. You are not a moment too soon. For your help I have placed a few scrolls in your pack to aid you.
1046080	Just a few Mark and Recall scrolls for you to try out. I've also given you some blank recall runes.
1046081	Now I can send the few remaining soldiers in to the cave to investigate the state of affairs.
1046082	On second thought, *YOU* would do much better against the wretched wraiths than any of our soldiers.
1046083	Go and gather any other supplies you think you will need and then return here. I will transport you below upon your return.
1046084	I was beginning to think you would not return. I am glad to see that I was mistaken.
1046085	Go now into the caves below and find out what you can about the creatures coming from there.
1046086	Slay 6 of the creatures and gather any information on their weaknesses that you can.
1046087	Remember that there is a teleporter somewhere in the cave that will lead back to the surface.
1046088	Mission Complete.  You have slain the restless souls as instructed. Return to Uzeraan to report.
1046089	Uzeraan looks very disturbed at your report.  After a long silence he speaks to you:
1046090	It seems the caves are lost to us as the restless souls you describe have made it their new home.
1046091	The villagers wanted me to thank you for your help and have given me some items to reward you with.
1046092	I have placed some reagents, a few scrolls and some gold in your pack.
1046093	The issue of the restless souls requires more investigation, but alas, a more pressing matter has surfaced.
1046094	My friend and associate, Aegis The Archmage of Moonglow, has been secretly working on a new spell formula.
1046095	The new spell would easily swing the tides in our favor in the battle against this unknown evil that has befallen us.
1046096	Apparently, many of Aegis' apprentices have been getting abducted in an attempt to force information from them.
1046097	I have just received word from Aegis that one of his most trusted students was taken!
1046098	We must send someone to find the apprentice and free him before he is slain! Time is limited!
1046099	You, dear friend, have proven yourself worthy of such a quest.  I have sent word to Aegis that I will send you to aid him.
1046100	Go and gather any supplies you may need for your journey. Return here when you are ready to depart for Moonglow.
1046101	Excellent. You have returned.  I will transport you to Moonglow now.
1046102	Upon your arrival, follow the path North and you will find Moonglow.
1046103	Aegis runs a reagent shop west of the teleporter park within the Moonglow city walls.
1046104	If you have any trouble finding it, ask other adventurers around you and I am sure someone will aid you.
1046105	Good luck, young mage. I hope you succeed. May the aethers have mercy upon us if you do not.
1046106	You have found Aegis!
1046107	The Archmage's face lights up as he spots you in the doorway.
1046108	Thank the heavens! Uzeraan said he would send someone, but I did not expect you so soon.
1046109	As I am sure Uzeraan has told you, one of my apprentices was abducted.
1046110	’Tis a bad omen, as this was one of the few apprentices who knew of my new spell formulas.
1046111	No doubt the mysterious dark force is behind the abduction of my most valuable student.
1046112	I must ask you to go after the evil undead that abducted my apprentice and return him to safety.
1046113	In their haste to escape, one of the abductors dropped a marked recall rune.
1046114	No doubt it leads to the place where they are holding my young wizard captive.
1046115	I have the rune right here. No?  Maybe in this pocket? No. Well - this is most embarrassing.
1046116	Go and fetch yourself some supplies for the forthcoming battle and I will continue my search for the rune.
1046117	Unfortunately, I have not been able to recover the rune yet. Please return in a few minutes. I will keep looking.
1046118	My ancestors smile upon me. I have found the rune to the prison camp.  With this rune we can find the lost apprentice.
1046119	I will transport you now to the location that was inscribed on this rune. I pray it takes you to my student wizard.
1046120	Slay his captors and release him from his bondage. Take these scrolls with you - they will help.
1046121	They are scrolls with the 'Unlock' spell inscribed upon them.  This spell can be very useful.
1046122	Remember however, that the Unlock spell only unlocks things that were locked using the 'Magic Lock' spell.
1046123	Also keep in mind that not only doors can be locked with the lock spell, but also containers of all sorts.
1046124	Now go. Time is short!  Return here when you have saved my apprentice.
1046125	Quest Complete! You have saved the apprentice.  Return to Aegis and speak with him.
1046126	Aegis smiles at you with a look of great satisfaction.
1046127	Well done young Mage!!!  Stay on the path of virtue and continue your lessons in the arcane arts.
1046128	I foresee that you will become a mighty spell wielder who will gain many honors throughout Britannia.
1046129	I thank you for saving my apprentice and therein saving our cause. I feel a reward is in order.
1046130	Gold is also always welcome I think, so here is a check for 1000 gold. Don't squander it now, ye hear?
1046131	Take this magical wizard's hat. It tends to be rough on the body, but does wonders for the mind.
1046132	I hope we meet again in the future my friend. I am indebted to you always.
1046133	Find Uzeraan.  Uzeraan will explain what you need to do next.
1046134	Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Shadow Wisps'. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.
1046135	Return to Uzeraan and tell him of your findings.
1046136	Find 75 Mandrake roots and return them to Uzeraan. Try checking the local reagent shops.
1046137	Gather supplies for battle and return to Uzeraan when you are ready.
1046138	Venture into the mining cave and slay 6 of the restless souls. Use the teleporter in the cave to return.
1046139	Find the teleporter in the cave and return to Uzeraan.
1046140	Gather any supplies you need and return to Uzeraan when you are ready to leave for Moonglow.
1046141	Find Aegis the Archmage in the city of Moonglow. His shop is west of the teleporter park.
1046142	Explore the town and gather supplies for battle. Return to Aegis when you are ready.
1046143	Check in with Aegis after a while to see if he has recovered the rune to the prison camp.
1046144	Find the prison camp where the abducted apprentice is being held. Slay his oppressors and free him.
1046145	Return to Aegis and tell him you have freed his apprentice.
1046146	Uzeraan lives in his mansion within the city of Haven.  Find him and he will give you instructions on tasks he would like you to do for him.
1046147	Uzeraan explains tasks for you to become a better blacksmith.  He has requested that you find an anvil and forge.
1046148	Uzeraan says: Hello!  I am the grand Conjurer, Uzeraan.  I have a few tasks I'd like you to perform.
1046149	These tasks will help you to become a better blacksmith and make tools to aid your smithing.  The tasks are not pointless, as an army needs the weapons and armor you make.
1046150	First, I would like you to find an anvil and forge.  The anvils and forges can be found on this floor of my mansion.
1046151	Forge a ringmail tunic with your smithy hammer or tongs.  Uzeraan has more information, once you make the ringmail tunic.
1046152	At the forge and anvil, you craft the items of your blacksmithy trade.  To protect yourself, you should craft a ringmail tunic.
1046153	To use an anvil and forge, you must be standing next to them.  An anvil and forge allows you to use tongs or a hammer.
1046154	The tongs or hammer you use are in your backpack or hand. Double-clicking the tongs or hammer should bring up a menu to allow you to blacksmith.
1046155	If you are too far from the anvil and forge, you will not get the menu.  If you do not have enough ingots in your backpack for the item you want to smith, then you will not be able to make it.
1046156	Visit Uzeraan once you have made your ringmail tunic.
1046157	Uzeraan explains why you need the ringmail tunic for protection.  The mountains south of the mansion have ore to mine, but may have a critter or two that are hostile.
1046158	Uzeraan says: Now that you have made a ringmail tunic, you will need more ingots to supply yourself for future armor and weapons you make.  Ingots are made from ore that you mine off of mountains.
1046159	There are mountains to the south of my mansion.  They may be dangerous, so make sure to wear your ringmail tunic before you leave.
1046160	Once you find the mountains, you can mine them with your trusty shovel or pickaxe.
1046161	Once you have completed mining five large iron ore piles from mountains or caves, visit Uzeraan.  There are four types of ore piles, the largest pile smelts for the most ingots.
1046162	To mine ore, you will need to use your shovel or pickaxe on the mountainside or on a cave floor.  Double-clicking the shovel or pickaxe allows you to use the item.  You can then target the mountain or cave floor.
1046163	If an area is out of ore, you will need to hunt further along a mountainside or in a cave for more spots to mine at.  Simply use your digging tool on different areas of the stone until you get some ore.
1046164	Ore comes in varying sizes.  The smaller the pile, the fewer ingots it will make when it is smelted.  You will need five large piles of iron ore to smelt into the ingots you need.
1046165	Uzeraan's forge can be used to smelt ore into iron ingots.  Those ingots can be used to make tools.  Visit Uzeraan once you have completed smelting the ore.
1046166	Smelt ore in town at the forge for iron ingots.  Visit Uzeraan once you have completed smelting the ingots.
1046167	Uzeraan says: Now that you have the five piles of ore, you will need to smelt them.  The forge allows you to smelt ore.
1046168	Once you find the forge, double-click the piles of ore and target the red coals of the forge.  The ore will be smelted into ingots, if you are close enough to the forge.
1046169	When you have made the iron ingots, visit Uzeraan and he will instruct you on how to make more pickaxes.
1046170	Make two pickaxes for mining with your tinker kit.  Show Uzeraan a pickaxe by giving it to him.
1046171	Shovels and pickaxes break fairly often while mining.  This means you will need to make pickaxes with the ingots you mine up
1046172	To make a couple of pickaxes, you can use your tinker tools on your ingots.  Select the pickaxe from the tinker menu and it will be made from the ingots you selected.
1046173	You can make these pickaxes anywhere, as long as you have the ingots.  This means if you ever run out of pickaxes while mining a mountainside, you can make more pickaxes right away!
1046174	Make fifty iron ingots for the mansion.  Visit Uzeraan once you have completed making the ingots.
1046175	Uzeraan says:  Now that you know how to keep your pickaxes in good supply and how to make iron ingots, I happen to be in need of a large pile of ingots.
1046176	Please make fifty ingots and bring them to me.  I will buy them from you for five-hundred gold.
1046177	Iron ore piles are heavy.  You will need to lug piles of ore you mine back to the mansion to smelt them into iron ingots.  This may take you a few trips back and forth between the mountains and the forge.
1046178	Once you have completed the ingots, visit me for your payment.
1046179	Uzeraan describes the order deeds the armourers need in Minoc.  Find the moongate at the south-east part of town.  This moongate will take you to a location just outside of Minoc.
1046180	Uzeraan says: You have done very well.  You know how to supply yourself with iron ingots and pickaxes.
1046181	Now, I have a more advanced task for you.  The city armourers of Minoc are in need of weapons and armor.  I have placed their order deeds in your backpack for you to fulfill.
1046182	To get to the city of Minoc, you will need to travel through the moongate.  The moongate is located to the south-east of town, towards the mountains.
1046183	The moongate allows you to travel to far destinations.  Select Trammel and then Minoc and accept the menu and it will whisk you away.  Once there, walk west towards the road.
1046184	Now that you have found the moongate, you should walk into it.  A menu will appear asking where you wish to travel to.
1046185	There are two types of moongates.  Moongates, such as the one you just found, are scattered through the world and offer menus of different locations.
1046186	The other type of moongate does not offer a menu.  It is a moongate that powerful mages may temporarily create to allow themselves and others to pass through them to marked locations.
1046187	If you cannot walk into the moongate, you may double-click it to use it.  If you are too far from the moongate, you cannot use the moongate.
1046188	Besides allowing you to travel between locations, you may use a moongate to go to another facet.  The two facets are Felucca and Trammel.
1046189	The city of Haven is in Trammel.  If you wish to travel back to Haven, you would need to select Trammel before selecting it as the city you wish to visit.
1046190	To visit Minoc, you may visit it in either Trammel or Felucca.  Although, the armourers that need the weapons and armor are in Trammel.
1046191	Select Trammel as the facet you wish to visit and then select Minoc as the city.  
1046192	The city of Minoc is a city of miners, tinkerers, and jewelers.  Minoc is to the north-northwest.  The mountains are north-east of Minoc.  You need to complete the order deeds in Minoc.
1046193	Minoc is to the north-west of the gate you have just exited from.  There is a road to the west that leads north into town.
1046194	The armourers have two shops in town.  They both have forges and anvils in them that you can use to make the weapons and armor in your order deeds.
1046195	If you pass through town, the mountains are to the north-east of Minoc.  You can use those mountains to mine the ore you need for ingots and blacksmithing.
1046196	The grey order deeds can be double-clicked to open them up and read what the amount and type of items are needed by the armourers.  Forge the items as you did for the ringmail tunic earlier with your blacksmithy hammer.
1046197	Use the combine button in the opened deed window to combine your finished products with the deed.  When you have finished the amount the orders are for, drag the deed onto an armourer or blacksmith in Minoc.
1046198	After the deeds have all been completed, travel through the moongate to Haven and find Uzeraan.
1046199	Once you have completed the deeds, Uzeraan will grant you a reward.
1046200	Uzeraan says: Congratulations!  I got word through magical means that you had completed your task.  The armourers were extremely happy to have received their orders fulfilled.
1046201	You have requested to cancel your quest.  Once you have cancelled your quest, you cannot start the young player quest again.  Do you wish to cancel your quest?
1046202	Now I can finally return to my family.  Will you go and tell Aegis that I am free and that I did not give away the secret of the new spell.
1046203	I have some unfinished business before I can return home.  Fare thee well kind adventurer.
1046204	Be sure to take your spellbook and I would also suggest that you have at least 35 of each reagent.
1046205	Be sure to take your spellbook and I would also suggest that you have at least 50 of each reagent.
1046206	We believe the vile 'Headless' are responsible for these disappearances.
1046207	Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Headless' creatures. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.
1046208	Well done! You have completed your task of slaying the 'Headless'.
1046209	You however, have shown great valor in your battle against the 'Headless'!
1046210	Well there is *ONE* way - Yes! That is it. Whilst I was installing the teleporter I marked a recall rune in the cave!
1046211	I can use this recall rune to transport you directly into the caverns. Alas, you must find your own way out.
1046212	Go and gather supplies for battle. I suggest you take your weapon, some armor and at least 25 bandages to be safe.
1046213	Return here when you are ready to depart and I will transport you into the caverns below the island.
1046214	It's a treasure map I received from a dragon tamer a long time ago. I have neither the time nor the patience to find the treasure.
1046215	Take the treasure map and this shovel.  Double click the treasure map, located in your pack, to see where the treasure is. X marks the spot.
1046216	I can teleport you close to where the treasure should be buried
1046217	It's North from here
1046218	It's North-East from here
1046219	It's East from here
1046220	It's South-East from there
1046221	It's South from here
1046222	It's South-West from here
1046223	It's West from here
1046224	It's North-West from here
1046225	* the magic fails *
1046226	an enchanted sextant
1046227	I'm sorry but it seems your backpack is too full to accept your reward. Come back when you have room for it.
1046228	To show me a pickaxe you have made, drag the pickaxe onto me and I will review your crafted pickaxe.
1046229	Through my magic, I was able to raise your blacksmithy skill a couple of points.
1046230	You need to clear some space in your backpack to continue with the quest.  Visit Uzeraan when you have more space in your backpack.
1046231	The treasure should be here on this island somewhere. I've also given you an enchanted sextant that will help you find your way.
1046232	You're standing right on top of the spot!
1046233	Press ALT-R to bring up your overhead map.  Then you can double click the enchanted sextant to tell you the way.
1046234	Take heed though, the magic of the sextant will only work for you. Don't give it away!
1046235	Once you have found the spot, you will need to follow these steps to bring up the treasure:
1046236	1. Double click your shovel
1046237	2. Target the Treasure map
1046238	3. Target the spot on the ground where the treasure is buried
1046239	If you are digging in the right spot, the chest will emerge, and the treasure's guardians will emerge.
1046240	You must slay all of the guardians before you can open the treasure chest.  Return here after you have completed the treasure hunt.
1046241	You have done well against the guardians of the treasure!  I feel I can entrust you with yet another quest.
1046242	We once used one of the caves below the island for mining purposes.
1046243	Return here when you are ready to depart for Moonglow.
1046244	Good luck, young fighter! I hope you succeed!  May the aethers have mercy on us if you do not.
1046245	Gather your weapon, armor and I suggest at least 30 bandages before you return.
1046246	Come back here after you have made the necessary arrangements and I will teleport you - providing I find the blasted rune.
1046247	Slay his captors and free him!  May your road to glory be paved with the blood of our oppressors.  Go now.
1046248	Well done young fighter! Stay on the path of virtue and glory and honor will be yours.
1046249	I foresee that you will become a mighty warrior.  I see fortune and glory on your path!
1046250	Take this magical sword.  It is a mighty fine weapon.  It will serve you well in your conquest against evil.
1046251	Go forth and kill at least 6 of the 'Headless' creatures. See if you can find evidence of our missing men.
1046252	Find and dig up the treasure.  Slay the guardians and take the booty that is rightfully yours.
1046253	Quest Complete!  You have found the treasure and have slain the guardians. Return to Uzeraan.
1046254	You have excavated the treasure. Return to Uzeraan.
1046255	I've given you a bag with some black, night sight potions. Drink them to see in the dark.  I've also included a few heal potions.
1046256	I have placed some bandages and heal potions in your pack, compliments of the villagers.
1046257	Are you sure you want to release your pet?
1046258	Your quest is complete.
1046259	Haven
1046260	You need to clear some space in your inventory to continue with the quest.  Come back here when you have more space in your inventory.
1046261	That's not enough my friend.  I need 75.  No less.
1046262	I can unfortunately not travel with you, but I have something that will help you find your way.
1046263	Take this enchanted sextant to help guide you on your journey back. Double click the sextant to show you the way to the nearest Moongate.
1046264	Once you find a Moongate, step into it and choose Moonglow as your destination.
1046265	The sextant refuses to be picked up by you
1046266	What misfortunes have befallen you that you would return without completing your task?
1046267	I have adjusted the magical teleporter to take you back.  Step onto the teleporter when you are ready.
1046268	Unfortunately, evil mages have relocated the prisoner to another camp.  Aegis has information on their whereabouts.
1046269	Seek out Aegis in Moonglow and see if he can transport you to the new location of his captured apprentice.
1046270	I have made the necessary adjustments to the Teleporter here. Step on to it when you are ready to depart.
1046271	On your way out, be sure to take a look at the 'Shadow Wisp' in the cage near the water fountain.
1046272	However, be sure to not attack the monsters in the cage as they are currently under the protection of the town guards.
1046273	You can find out if a creature is attackable or not by the color of their name when you look at them (single click).
1046274	If the name is in blue, then you may not attack them without becoming a criminal.
1046275	Needless to say, becoming a criminal in town will most certainly be detrimental to your health.
1046276	The monsters that you will encounter outside of this mansion, however will highlight grey, which means you can freely attack them.
1046277	Now please go. Time is short, dear friend.
1046278	On your way out, be sure to take a look at the 'Headless' in the cage near the water fountain
1046279	Please also note the blacksmith standing next to the magic teleporter. He sells armor and weapons.
1046280	It may be wise to purchase some equipment from him.  I would suggest armor made of ringmail and perhaps a shield.
1046281	Don't spend all your money on armor though, as you will no doubt at some time wish to purchase bolts of cloth for bandages.
1046282	Cloth can be purchased from tailors and can be cut up with scissors to create bandages.
1046283	Use bandages on yourself (double click bandages and target yourself) any time your hit points get too low.
1046284	Bandages are very cost-effective. Of course, you could also drink a healing potion (yellow) to heal your damage.
1046285	Potions, however, can be costly and require a free hand to drink.  Purchasing any of these items is easy.
1046286	Simply walk up to the appropriate vendor and say the words 'Vendor Buy', or use the vendor's context menu.
1046287	You have died.
1046288	As a ghost you cannot interact with the world. You cannot touch items nor can you use them.
1046289	You can pass through doors as though they do not exist.  However, you cannot pass through walls.
1046290	No one can understand what you say whilst you are dead, unless they are using the 'Spirit Speak' skill to understand your words.
1046291	Since you are a new player, any items you had on your person at the time of your death will be in your backpack upon resurrection.
1046292	To be resurrected you must find a healer in town or wandering in the wilderness.  Some powerful players may also be able to resurrect you.
1046293	While you are still in young status, you will be transported to the nearest healer (along with your items) at the time of your death.
1046294	To rejoin the world of the living simply walk near one of the NPC healers, and they will resurrect you as long as you are not marked as a criminal.
1046295	Target the book you wish to copy.
1046296	That is not a book
1046297	You may not loot this mongbat. Find the one that took your gold.
1046298	This mongbat does not have your gold. You need to find the mongbat that highlights grey.
1046299	No one is allowed to enter this cave from here.
1046300	This yellow potion needs to be in your backpack before you may use it.

1046302	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0>But, ya see, one of those mongbats over there took the gold from me just before you arrived. I think you'll be able to get the gold back from the creature. Don't worry, I can teach you some things you'll need to know.</BASEFONT></BODY>

1046306	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0>First, you need to open your paperdoll and your inventory. We're going to equip your dagger; to do this, you click and hold your left mouse button on the dagger, drag the dagger onto your paperdoll, and then release the mouse button.</BASEFONT></BODY>

1046319	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0>Continue</BASEFONT></BODY>
1046320	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0>Alright, now it's time to attack the mongbat that took your gold.</BASEFONT></BODY>
1046321	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0>To attack someone or something, you double left click them while in War Mode. You only need to double left click them one time, though for most weapons you'll need to be standing directly next to your target in order to swing at them.</BASEFONT></BODY>

1046327	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0>No problem. You switch between War and Peace modes by left clicking the Peace or War button on your paperdoll. You may also use the keyboard shortcut, ALT-C.</BASEFONT></BODY>
1046328	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0>When in War Mode, you will take a combat stance and the button on your paperdoll will say, 'War' and will turn red.</BASEFONT></BODY>

1046354	Deeds completed:
1046355	Large ore:
1046356	If you are leaving the mansion, you should learn about the Radar Map.
1046357	The Radar Map (or Overhead View) can be opened by pressing 'ALT-R' on your keyboard. It shows your immediate surroundings from a bird's eye view.
1046358	Pressing ALT-R twice, will enlarge the Radar Map a little.  The map shows you your immediate surroundings from a bird's eye view.
1046359	You can close the map by right clicking on it.  Use the Radar Map often as you travel throughout the world to familiarize yourself with your surroundings.
1046360	Why are you giving me this?  You need to make pickaxes!
1046361	You have not made two pickaxes.  Come back and show me your work when you have both completed.
1046362	Yes
1046363	No
1046364	Remember that context menus can be called up by single left clicking something (or shift-left click if you have changed the option).
1046365	After you have indicated to the vendor that you wish to purchase something, you will be shown a list of the goods they have to offer.
1046366	Speaking of context menus, you can bring up the status of your quest by bringing up your avatar's own context menu (single left, or shift-left click yourself).
1046367	Choose the 'Quest Log' option, and any information pertinent to your current quest status will be shown to you.
1046368	To help you find the location of the treasure, you should become familiar with the Radar Map.
1046369	The teleporter to the caves is against the north wall of this room.
1046370	May good luck and fortune guide your way.
1046371	Once you emerge from the Moongate, the city will be roughly to the north.  It should not be difficult to find.  Find Aegis and speak with him once you are in the city..
1046372	Actually, before you can spend this money, you will have to take the check to a bank and cash it.
1046373	NPC shop keepers do not accept checks as payment.  Checks are a handy way to transport large sums of money without having to lug all that gold around.
1046374	Cashing a check is very easy.  All you have to do is locate a NPC Banker or Minter, walk near them and say the word 'Bank'.
1046375	Place the check into your bank box and double click it to cash it.  Bankers and Minters can be found inside of banks across the world.
1046376	There is a bank not too far from here, Southeast of this shop, actually.  Banks are often crowded with people conducting business.
1046377	Go now to cash your check.  The person cashing your check will explain the details of Britannia's banking system to you.
1046378	Ah! Thank you noble adventurer!  I have accepted your check and cashed it for you.  The cash can be found in your bank box.
1046379	To open your bank box, you must be near a Banker or Minter and say the word 'Bank'.
1046380	Of course you can also open your bank box by using a Minter's or Banker's context menu.
1046381	Bank boxes in Britannia are special in that the goods you place in to a bank box anywhere, can be accessed from your bank box anywhere else in the land.
1046382	That is to say, your bank box, along with any goods you placed into it,  is accessible from any bank in the land.
1046383	The safest place for any of your goods, is your bank box.  No one can access it except for you.
1046384	That's pretty much all there is to banking.  I bet you are eager to explore the world, so I won't hold you up any longer.
1046385	I've no tasks for you to complete, and you are free to adventure in the world on your own.
1046386	May your bank box overflow with the spoils of your adventures.  We shall no doubt see each other again.
1046387	Farewell.
1046388	Locate the bank and find the NPC Banker (or Minter) inside.  Then, say the word 'Bank' and place your check into your bank box and double click it.
1046389	To make it easier to find the Treasure, be sure to use your radar map.
1046390	To make your attack, you will most likely wish to use your magical powers, so allow me to give you a brief explanation of magic.
1046391	Most often, spells start out as scrolls written by either NPC or Player scribes.  Once a spell has been successfully scribed, you have two choices:
1046392	One: You can cast the spell by using (double click) the scroll.  No spell reagents (ingredients) are required to cast spells from scrolls. Casting from a scroll consumes the scroll.
1046393	Two: You can drop the scroll on to your spellbook where it will be permanently written.  You can then cast the spell from your spellbook any time you wish.
1046394	To cast a spell from a spellbook, the necessary reagents are required (listed with the spell in your spellbook). 
1046395	Casting spells from a spellbook AND casting spells from scrolls requires a certain amount of mana. The actual amount of mana required differs from circle to circle.
1046396	The 1st circle of spells is the easiest of spells to cast (and also has the least mana requirement) whilst 8th circle spells are difficult even for a Grandmaster Mage.
1046397	To actually cast a spell from your spellbook, you must first open your spellbook (double click).  This opens the book to the 1st & 2nd circle spells.
1046398	You can turn pages by single clicking the corner in the top right hand side of the spellbook, or you can single click on the circled numbers on the bottom to jump to specific circle.
1046399	You can double click any of the spell names to make an attempt at casting that spell.  To see a spell's reagent requirements, single click on the spell name.
1046400	Single clicking on a spell name will give you all the details of the spell.  You can see the aforementioned reagent requirements as well as the spell's icon.
1046401	Another way of casting a spell is to click on that spell's spell icon.  You can drag any spell's icon off of the book and place it anywhere in the game window.
1046402	Once a spell icon is in the game window, it will stay there even if you close the spellbook.  This is an easy way to set up many spells for quick casting.
1046403	Before going into battle, you should always check your reagent supply and make sure you have your spell icons set up.
1046404	You now have enough Mandrake in your pack to complete your task for Uzeraan.  Find Uzeraan and give him 75 mandrake roots by dragging them onto him.
1046405	You have enough Mandrake in your pack to complete your task for Uzeraan.  Find Uzeraan and give him 75 mandrake roots by dragging them onto him.
1046406	I have drawn you a picture of what the Reagent Shop sign looks like (left).   Remember that you can also look at (single click) shop signs to read them.
1046407	Marking runes is easy.  I'll give you a quick explanation of how it works, then I would advise that you mark a rune somewhere around my mansion so you can return quickly.
1046408	To mark a rune, you must stand in the place where you wish to appear when casting the 'Recall' or 'Gate' spell.
1046409	Then you cast the mark spell (either from a scroll or your spellbook, as I have explained earlier).  Once the spell is cast you will get a targeting cursor.
1046410	Target the rune you wish to mark and single click it.  If your spell is successful, the rune will sparkle and will from then on be 'marked'.
1046411	Looking at the rune (single click) will give you the description of the rune.  If you wish to change the default description, simply double click the rune.
1046412	Once you have double clicked the rune, you will get a text prompt.  Enter the new description and press the [enter] key on your keyboard.
1046413	By naming all of your runes to something that is meaningful to you, you can keep your rune library organized and easy to use.
1046414	the remains of ~1_NAME~
1046415	~1_bulkname~ / ~2_amountreq~ ~3_intamount~ / ~4_excep~ / ~5_ingottype~ / ~6_itemname~
1046416	During combat it is important to keep an eye on your hit points.  Should they ever drop below 0, you will die.
1046417	To bring up your status bar, single click yourself and drag away from your avatar.  Double click the status bar to see details.
1046418	If your health drops too low, you should heal yourself with bandages or healing potions.  Heal yourself often, and you should have no trouble surviving.
1046419	One more thing before you depart for battle:
1046420	You have found a Moongate.  Remember to choose 'Moonglow' as your destination when you step into the gate.
1046421	Moonglow is where Aegis is waiting for you in his shop.
1046422	Congratulations! You've completed all of your quests!
1046423	I can open a Moongate for you from here to an area close to the Moongate that can take you to the city of Moonglow.
1046424	I only have runes marked for near the Moongate, but the sextant will help you find the rest of the way.
1046425	Aegis' Shop
1046426	I have drawn you a picture to the left of what the sign on Aegis' Shop looks like. It should help you find it a little easier.
1046427	You do not have enough reagents to safely go on.  You should acquire at least 35 of each reagent.
1046428	There are 8 types of reagent: Mandrake, Nightshade, Black Pearl, Sulfurous Ash, Spider's Silk, Garlic, Ginseng and Bloodmoss.
1046429	The caves tend to be dark, so be sure to cast the 'Night Sight' spell on yourself if you have trouble seeing.

1048049	I don't feel comfortable sending you into this battle with the amount of reagents you currently have on your person.
1048050	Please go and gather at least 35 of each reagent before returning.
1048051	Remember that there are 8 different reagents: Spider's Silk, Bloodmoss, Mandrake, Ginseng, Nightshade, Garlic, Black Pearl and Sulfurous Ash.
1048052	Double click the grey order deeds to open them.  Once open, the deed lists which items and what quantity the armourer needs.  Once you forge an item, combine the item with the deed by choosing ‘Combine Item’ and targeting the item.
1048053	You can't stable that!
1048054	Uzeraan explains the bank is on the north side of town.  Take your bank check to a banker and drop it on the banker to cash it in.
1048055	Uzeraan says: Congratulations!  I got word through magical means that you had completed your task.  The armourers were extremely happy to have received their orders fulfilled.
1048056	Through my magic, I was able to raise your blacksmithy skill a couple points.  Now, I would like to let you take some time to put your goods in the bank. The bank is right next to the mansion to the southeast.
1048057	As you approach the bank, the names of bankers and their titles of 'banker' or 'minter' will appear.  This means you have located the building where you can access your bank account.
1048058	How to open your bank account by saying the word 'bank' and depositing items.  Once finished, visit Uzeraan and he will give you a pack horse.
1048059	Ah! Thank you noble adventurer!  I have accepted your check and cashed it for you.  The cash can be found in your bank box.
1048060	Of course you can also open your bank box by using a Minter's or Banker's context menu.
1048061	Bank boxes in Britannia are special in that the goods you place into a bank box anywhere can be accessed from your bank box anywhere else in the land.
1048062	The safest place for any of your goods is your bank box.  No one can access your bank box except for you.
1048063	After you have finished depositing items in your bank, visit Uzeraan for a pack horse.
1048064	Uzeraan explains how to use a pack horse.  Take your pack horse to mountains south of Uzeraan's castle.
1048065	Pack horses are used to carry large quantities of items that you normally could not fit in your backpack.  Miners use them for carrying large quantities of ore, ingots, and some tools.
1048066	Pack horses are loyal to their masters unless they are not fed.  Apples or pears are foods that the pack horses appreciate and will keep them loyal.
1048067	Once you have renamed your pack horse, you can have your pet obey commands.  The most common commands are 'follow me' and 'stay'.  However, your pet must be in range to hear you.
1048068	All pets you own can be renamed.  Click and hold the left mouse button on the pack horse and drag its health bar.
1048069	Try walking away from your pack horse and tell it to follow you by left-clicking on the pack horse and select the command 'follow'.
1048070	To get your pet to stay, you would tell it to stay by left-clicking on the pack horse and select the command 'stay' from the command list.
1048071	Mine 40 piles of ore from the mountains and use your pack horse to haul the piles of ore.  Visit Uzeraan at his mansion once you have the 40 piles of ore.
1048072	Now that you know how to handle your pack horse, use your new pack horse to haul 40 large piles of ore from the mountains.  You will need to tinker a couple more shovels to be able to mine the ore.
1048073	You can double-click on your pack horse to open its backpack.  While open, you can load your pack horse by dropping items into its backpack.
1048074	Uzeraan encourages you to practice to 70 skill in blacksmithy.  You do not have to train immediately.  When you have reached 70 skill, visit Uzeraan.
1048075	Uzeraan says: Congratulations!  You have mastered the basics of mining and blacksmithy.  I am giving you 500 gold for your ore.  You may keep your pack horse.
1048076	Now that you have accomplished so much, you should train your blacksmithy skill so you may perform a more difficult task.  It may take some time to train to 70 skill.  I have a task to ask of you when you have finished training.
1048077	You do not need to hurry out and train.  The world is waiting to be explored and some adventurers may need your skills.  Come visit me when you have trained to 70 skill (or higher).
1048078	Now that you are an accomplished blacksmith, Uzeraan has another set of orders the armourers of Minoc would like you to fulfill.  Once completed, give them to an armourer or blacksmith in the city of Minoc.
1048079	Uzeraan says: Ah, I see that you are well on your way to mastering blacksmithy.  I have four order deeds that the armourers would like you to fulfill in Minoc.
1048080	One of the deeds is the large order, which must be combined to completed order deeds.  The three smaller deeds are for chainmail.
1048081	Combine the items requested in the order with the small deed.  Once the deed is completed, you can use the large order deed to combine with a smaller deed.
1048082	The large order deed, when it is filled with all of the small deeds, would then be dropped onto an armourer or blacksmith in Minoc.  They will make sure your goods go to those in need.
1048083	Visit Uzeraan once you have completed the orders for the armourers of Minoc.
1048084	Mastering blacksmithy
1048085	Now that you have helped the blacksmiths of Minoc, you have proved your worthiness of mastering blacksmithy.
1048086	When you have reached 100 skill in blacksmithy, you will have the ability to mark your crafted items with your name.
1048087	Folk from around the world of Britannia can wear your signed armor and wield your signature weapons when you are a grandmaster blacksmith.
1048088	You have just slain your first 'Headless'. Now is a good time to check your health and heal yourself, if need be.
1048089	To check your health, single left-click + drag away from your avatar. This brings up your status bar. 
1048090	Double click the status bar to see detailed information. Check your hitpoints and determine if you would like to heal yourself at this point or not. 
1048091	To heal yourself you may use bandages (double click bandages and target yourself) or drink a heal potion (free one of your hands and double click the potion).
1048092	Alternatively, if you know your way around spellbooks and such, you can cast the Heal or Greater Heal spells to recover lost hitpoints.
1048093	You have slain the leader of the pack.
1048094	Be sure to check his corpse (double click) for the red box which holds the key to the cage in which the apprentice is being held.
1048095	Cast the Unlock spell on the red box to open the lock.
1048096	Open (double click) the red box and find the key inside. Take the key (drag and drop into your pack).
1048097	Use the key (double click) and target the door on the prison cage. This will unlock the door.
1048098	Now you can open the door (double click) to free the apprentice.
1048099	You have just slain your first 'Shadow Wisp'. Now is a good time to check your health and heal yourself if need be.
1048100	A Time For Healing
1048101	The Leader Lies Dead
1048102	You should have a bank check in your backpack (a yellow check).  Speak the word 'bank' to open your bank box, drag your bank check into the box, and double-click it to cash it in.
1048103	Visit Uzeraan after you have loaded 40 large piles of ore onto your pack horse.
1048104	To feed your pack horse, you would drag one apple or pear onto your pack horse.  A good practice is to feed your pack horse once an hour.
1048105	Click on the name on the health bar, delete its current name and type in a new name like 'Ed' or 'Trigger' (without spaces in the name).
1048106	The pack horse should whinny and walk towards you (unless it is not well fed), after you target yourself with the target cursor.
1048107	If the list has not ever displayed, try holding the shift key and left-clicking on the pack horse.  Take your pack horse south to the mountains to receive further instructions.

1049321	Find the High Mage <I>Schmendrick</I> in the mines and recover the scroll of power from him.
1049322	<I>Schmendrick barely pays you any attention as you approach him.  His mind seems to be occupied with something else.  You explain to him that you came for the scroll of power and after a long while he begins to speak, but apparently still not giving you his full attention...</I><BR><BR>Hmmm.. peculiar indeed.  Very strange activity here indeed... I wonder...<BR><BR>Hmmm.  Oh yes! Scroll, you say?  I don't have it, sorry. My apprentice was carrying it, and he ran off to somewhere in this cave.  Find him and you will find the scroll.<BR><BR>Be sure to bring the scroll to Uzeraan once you have it. He's the only person aside from myself who can read the ancient markings on the scroll.  I need to figure out what's going on down here before I can leave.  Strange activity indeed...<BR><BR><I>Schmendrick goes back to his work and you seem to completely fade from his awareness...
1049323	Find Schmendrick's apprentice who is somewhere in the mining cave.  The apprentice has the scroll of power needed by Uzeraan.
1049324	You have obtained the scroll of power!  Find your way out of the cave.<BR><BR>Hand the scroll to Uzeraan (drag and drop) once you arrive in his mansion.
1049325	<I>Uzeraan carefully unravels the scroll and begins to read...after a short while his face lights up with a smile and he speaks to you...</I><BR><BR>This is wonderful, friend!  For your troubles I've given you a treasure map I had laying about, along with a shovel to <a href = "?ForceTopic91">dig up the treasure</a>.  Feel free to find the treasure at your leisure.<BR><BR>Now let us get back to the business of this scroll. The only trouble, is that this scroll calls for some special ingredients that I do not have on hand.<BR><BR>Though it may involve some danger, I will ask of you to find these reagents for me.  <BR><BR>There are three reagents I need to complete the spell.<BR><BR>The first thing I need is some <I>Fertile Dirt</I>.<BR><BR>There lives a Dryad on this island who I know would have such a thing on hand.  I have recalibrated the teleporter to transport you to the Dryad's grove, which lies <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South-West</a> of this mansion.<BR><BR>Tell her Uzeraan sent you, and she should cooperate.<BR><BR>Should you get into trouble out there or should you lose your way, do not worry.  I have also given you a magical horn - a <I>Horn of Retreat</I>.  Play the horn at any time to open a magical gateway that leads back to this mansion.<BR><BR>Should your horn run out of <a href = "?ForceTopic83">charges</a>, simply hand me or any of my mansion guards the horn to have it recharged.<BR><BR>Good luck friend.
1049326	<I>The Dryad watches hungrily as you approach, giving you an uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach.  You explain that Uzeraan has sent you for a quantity of fertile dirt.  With a wide grin and in a slightly hoarse voice she replies...</I><BR><BR><I>Fertile Dirt</I>, eh?  Well, I have a few patches here...but what have you brought me in return?  Came empty-handed did you?  That's unfortunate indeed... but since you were sent by my dear friend Uzeraan, I supposed I could oblige you.<BR><BR><I>The Dryad digs around in the ground and hands you a patch of Fertile Dirt.<BR><BR>With a smile she goes back to her work...</I>
1049327	You have acquired the <I>Fertile Dirt</I>!<BR><BR>Return to the mansion (<a href = "?ForceTopic13">North-East</a> of the Dryad's Grove) and hand it to Uzeraan.
1049328	NullString.
1049329	<I>Uzeraan takes the dirt from you and smiles...<BR><BR></I>Wonderful!  I knew I could count on you.  As a token of my appreciation I've given you a bag with some bandages as well as some healing potions.  They should help out a bit.<BR><BR>The next item I need is a <I>Vial of Blood</I>.  I know it seems strange, but that's what the formula asks for.  I have some locked away in a chest not far from here.  It's only a short distance from the mansion.  Let me give you directions...<BR><BR>Exit the front door to the East.  Then follow the path to the North.  You will pass by several pedestals with lanterns on them.  Continue on this path until you run into a small hut.  Walk up the stairs and through the door.  Inside you will find a chest.  Open it and bring me a <I>Vial of Blood</I> from inside the chest.  It's very easy to find.  Just follow the road and you can't miss it.<BR><BR>Good luck!
1049330	You have been ambushed! Fight for your honor!!!
1049331	You take a vial of blood from the chest and put it in your pack.
1049332	You have the vial of blood!<BR><BR>Return to Uzeraan's mansion and hand him the vial.
1049333	<I>You hand Uzeraan the Vial of Blood, which he hastily accepts...</I><BR><BR>Excellent work!  Only one reagent remains and the spell is complete!  The final requirement is a <I>Daemon Bone</I>, which will not be as easily acquired as the previous two components.<BR><BR>There is a haunted graveyard on this island, which is the home to many undead creatures.   Dispose of the undead as you see fit.  Be sure to search their remains after you have smitten them, to check for a <I>Daemon Bone</I>.  I'm quite sure that you will find what we seek, if you are thorough enough with your extermination.<BR><BR>Take this magical silver sword to aid you in your battle.  Silver weapons will damage the undead twice as much as your regular weapon.<BR><BR>Return here when you have found a <I>Daemon Bone</I>.
1049334	Head <a href = "?ForceTopic13">East</a> of here (or use the Horn of Retreat) to return to Uzeraan's Mansion and deliver the bone to Uzeraan.
1049335	<I>As you hand Uzeraan the final reagent, he nods at you with approval and starts searching through the pockets of his robe...<BR><BR>After a short while he hands you a small pouch...</I><BR><BR>There you are.  Your contract of employment with me has expired and so here is your pay.  2000 gold in the form of a check and a magical sextant that will help you find <a href = "?ForceTopic47">Moongates</a> and Banks.<BR><BR>Before you can actually spend the money I have given you, however, you must <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash the check</a>.<BR><BR>I have recalibrated the teleporter to take you to the Haven <a href="?ForceTopic38">Bank</a>.  Step onto the teleporter to be taken to the bank, which lies <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South-East</a> of here.<BR><BR>Thank you for all your help friend.  I hope we shall meet each other again in the future.<BR><BR>Farewell.
1049336	Locate the Haven Bank (use the teleporter in Uzeraan's Mansion if necessary), which lies <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South-East</a> of Uzeraan's Mansion.  Once there, <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash your check</a>.
1049337	<I>The banker smiles at you and greets you in a loud and robust voice...</I><BR><BR>Well hello there adventurer!  I see you've learned how to cash checks.  Wonderful!  Let me tell you a bit about the banks in this world...<BR><BR>Anything that you place into any bank box, can be retrieved from any other bank box in the land.  For instance, if you place an item into a bank box in Haven, it can be retrieved from your bank box in Britain or any other city.<BR><BR> Bank boxes are very secure.  So secure, in fact, that no one can ever get into your bank box except for yourself.  Security is hard to come by these days, but you can trust in the banking system of Britannia!  We shall not let you down! <BR><BR>I hope to be seeing much more of you as your riches grow!  May your bank box overflow with the spoils of your adventures.<BR><BR>Farewell adventurer, you are now free to explore the world on your own.
1049338	You find a vial of blood, but can't pick it up because your pack is too full.  Come back when you have more room in your pack.
1049339	Your pack is too full to carry the sword that Uzeraan wishes to give you.  Talk to Uzeraan again when you have enough room in your pack and he will give you the sword at that time.
1049340	Uzeraan hands you a finely crafted sword which you immediately place into your backpack.
1049341	You rummage through the bones and find a Daemon Bone!  You quickly place the item in your pack.
1049342	Rummaging through the bones you find a Daemon Bone, but can't pick it up because your pack is too full.  Come back when you have more room in your pack.
1049343	You can only drop quest items into the top-most level of your backpack while you still need them for your quest.
1049344	You decide against trading the item.  You still need it for your quest.
1049345	You've lost the scroll?  Argh!  I will have to try and re-construct the scroll from memory.  Bring me a blank scroll, which you can <a href = "?ForceTopic33">purchase from the mage shop</a> just <a href = "?ForceTopic13">East</a> of Uzeraan's mansion in Haven.<BR><BR>Return the scroll to me and I will try to make another scroll for you.<BR><BR>When you return, be sure to hand me the scroll (drag and drop).
1049346	Schmendrick scribbles on the scroll for a few moments and hands you the finished product.
1049347	You've <I>lost</i> the vial blood?  Oh my...  Please go back to the chest and fetch another one.  It's important that we have all of the ingredients.
1049348	All items must be made with spined leather.

1049358	Find the Dryad in the woods of Haven and get a patch of fertile dirt from her.<BR><BR>Use Uzeraan's teleporter to get there if necessary.
1049359	You've lost the dirt I gave you?<BR><BR>My, my, my... What ever shall we do now?<BR><BR>I can try to make you some more, but I will need something that I can transform.  Bring me an <I>apple</I>, and I shall see what I can do.<BR><BR>You can <a href = "?ForceTopic33">buy</a> apples from the Provisioner's Shop, which is located a ways <a href = "?ForceTopic13">East</a> of Uzeraan's mansion.<BR><BR>Hand me the apple when you have it, and I shall see about transforming it for you.<BR><BR>Good luck.<BR><BR>
1049360	<I>The Dryad sticks the apple into the ground and you watch it rot before your eyes.<BR><BR>She pulls the now fertile dirt out of the ground and hands it to you.</I><BR><BR>There you go friend.  Try not to lose it again this time, eh?
1049361	Bring back a vial of blood.<BR><BR>Follow the road leading north from the mansion and walk into the hut to find the chest that contains the vial

1049375	You return without <I>a Vial of Blood</I>?  It is imperative that we get all of the ingredients friend.<BR><BR>Go back to the chest and fetch another vial.  Please hurry.

We desperately need help!<BR><BR>Your first task will be to assess the situation in the mountain pass, and help our troops defeat the Horde Minions there.<BR><BR>Take the road marked with glowing runes, that starts just outside of this mansion. Before you go into battle, it would be prudent to <a href="?ForceTopic35">review your magic skills</a> as well as <a href = "?ForceTopic29">information on healing yourself</a>.<BR><BR>To aid you in your fight, you may also wish to <a href = "?ForceTopic33">purchase equipment</a> from Frank the Blacksmith, who is standing just <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South</a> of here.<BR><BR>Good luck young mage.
1049387	<I>You give your report to Uzeraan and after a while, he begins to speak...</I><BR><BR>Your report is grim,  but all hope is not lost!  It has become apparent that our swords and spells will not drive the evil from Haven.<BR><BR>The head of my order, the High Mage Schmendrick, arrived here shortly after you went into battle with the <I>Horde Minions</I>.  He has brought with him a scroll of great power, that should aid us greatly in our battle.<BR><BR>Unfortunately, the entrance to one of our mining caves collapsed recently, trapping our miners inside.<BR><BR>Schmendrick went to install magical teleporters inside the mines so that the miners would have a way out.  The miners have since returned, but Schmendrick has not. Those who have returned, all seem to have lost their minds to madness; mumbling strange things of "the souls of the dead seeking revenge".<BR><BR>No matter. We must find Schmendrick.<BR><BR>Step onto the teleporter, located against the wall, and seek Schmendrick in the mines.<BR><BR>I've given you a bag with some <a href="?ForceTopic93">Travel Spells</a>, in case you need to make a quick escape. In addition, you may wish to cast the <a href="?ForceTopic92">Night Sight</a> spell on yourself before going into the cave, as it it's pretty dark in there.<BR><BR>Now please go. Good luck, friend.
1049388	<I>Uzeraan takes the dirt from you and smiles...<BR><BR></I>Wonderful!  I knew I could count on you.  As a token of my appreciation I've given you a bag with some <a href = "?ForceTopic37">reagents</a> as well as some <a href="?ForceTopic35">spell scrolls</a>.  They should help out a bit.<BR><BR>The next item I need is a <I>Vial of Blood</I>.  I know it seems strange, but that's what the formula asks for.  I have some locked away in a chest not far from here.  It's only a short distance from the mansion.  Let me give you directions...<BR><BR>Exit the front door to the East.  Then follow the path to the North.  You will pass by several pedestals with lanterns on them.  Continue on this path until you run into a small hut.  Walk up the stairs and through the door.  Inside you will find a chest.  Open it and bring me a <I>Vial of Blood</I> from inside the chest.  It's very easy to find.  Just follow the road and you can't miss it.<BR><BR>Good luck!
1049389	I>You hand Uzeraan the Vial of Blood, which he hastily accepts...</I><BR><BR>Excellent work!  Only one reagent remains and the spell is complete!  The final requirement is a <I>Daemon Bone</I>, which will not be as easily acquired as the previous two components.<BR><BR>There is a haunted graveyard on this island, which is the home to many undead creatures.   Dispose of the undead as you see fit.  Be sure to search their remains after you have smitten them, to check for a <I>Daemon Bone</I>.  I'm quite sure that you will find what we seek, if you are thorough enough with your extermination.<BR><BR>Take these explosion spell scrolls and  magical wizard's hat to aid you in your battle.  The scrolls should help you make short work of the undead.<BR><BR>Return here when you have found a <I>Daemon Bone</I>.
1049390	I don't feel comfortable sending you into a potentially dangerous situation with as few <a href = "?ForceTopic37">reagents</a> as you have in your pack.<BR><BR>Before going on, please acquire at least 30 of each reagent.  You can <a href ="?ForceTopic33">purchase</a> reagents from the Mage shop, which is located just <a href ="?ForceTopic13">East</a> this mansion.<BR><BR>Remember that there are eight (8) different reagents: Black Pearl, Mandrake Root, Sulfurous Ash, Garlic, Ginseng, Blood Moss, Nightshade and Spider's Silk.<BR><BR>Come back here when you are ready to go.

1049549	Youthful Treasuremaps
1049550	Treasure maps are pieces of paper that will show the location of a buried treasure somewhere in the land.<BR><BR>To find this treasure, a few simple steps must be followed.<BR><BR><U>1.</U> Use the <a href = "?90">context menu</a> on the map to decode the map. Once a map is decoded, it will no longer have the word "tattered" in it's title.  This is a handy thing to know if you want to find out if a map has been previously decoded or not.  This is important, since only the person that decoded the map, can actually dig up the treasure.<BR><BR><U>2.</U> Finding the treasure is a rather simple procedure on youthful treasuremaps.  You will need some sort of digging device (like a shovel or a pickaxe) to unearth the treasure.  Once you have secured your tools, you will need to open the map (double click) and take a look at it.  Use your <a href = "?14">Radar Map</a> to see if you can somewhat figure out where the treasure might be by comparing the drawing on the map and the picture from the the overhead Radar.<BR><BR>If you are having trouble making out the area,  the best thing to do is to find a patch of grass or dirt (out in the woods perhaps), and start digging.  Digging is easily accomplished by using the "Dig for Treasure" <a href = "?90">context menu</a> on the map.<BR><BR>Once you select the digging option, target the place on the ground that you wish to dig at.  If you are not at the correct spot, you will get help message telling you which direction to move in.  Follow the directions and keep digging until you find the chest.<BR><BR><U>3.</U> Once the chest has emerged, the treasure's guardians will appear.  You must defeat all of the treasure's guardians before you can loot the chest.<BR><BR>Good luck.
1049551	The Nightsight Spell
1049552	The Nightsight Spell is a 1st circle spell, and can be cast by nearly everyone.  The effect of the spell is such, that the person who is targeted by the spell will be able to see in the dark.  This spell is especially useful in dungeons and dark woods.<BR><BR>The two <a href = "?37">reagents</a>  that are required for this spell, are Spider's Silk and Sulfurous Ash.
1049553	Travel Spells
1049554	There are three (3) magic spells that can be used to transport yourself and your friends to anywhere in the world - instantaneously.<BR><BR><U><a href = "?94">The Mark Spell</a></U><BR><BR>This spell is the basis for the other travels spells. It allows you mark a location that you wish to return to at a later time, using one of the other two travel spells. <a href = "?94">more...</a><BR><BR><U><a href = "?95">The Recall Spell</a></U><BR><BR>This is the easiest of the two transport spells to cast.  It allows one traveler (the person casting) to teleport to a previously <a href="?94">marked</a> location. <a href = "?95">more...</a><BR><BR><U><a href = "?96">The Gate Spell</a></u><BR><BR>This spell allows the caster to open a magical gate that allows anyone that steps into it to travel to a previously <a href="?94">marked</a> location. <a href = "?96">more...</a>.
1049555	The Mark Spell
1049556	The Mark Spell is a sixth (6th) circle spell and requires the <I>Black Pearl</I>, <I>Bloodmoss</I> and <I>Mandrake Root</I> <a href = "?37">reagents</a>.<BR><BR>Casting the spell will bring up a targeting cursor.  Target any rune (which can be <a href = "?33">purchased</a> from most magic shops) to <i>mark</i> that rune with your current location.  If the spell is successful, the rune will be permanently marked.  You can mark over an already marked rune, which replaces your new location with the old location.<BR><BR>Once a rune is marked, you can use either the <a href = "?94">Recall</a> or the <a href = "?96">Gate</a> spell to travel back to the marked location, instantaneously.
1049557	The Recall Spell
1049558	The Recall Spell is a fourth (4th) circle spell and requires the <I>Black Pearl</I>, <I>Bloodmoss</I> and <I>Mandrake Root</I> <a href = "?37">reagents</a>.<BR><BR>Casting the spell will bring up a targeting cursor.  Target any previously <a href="?94">marked</a> rune, to attempt to instantly teleport to the location at which the rune was <a href="?94">marked</a>.  If the destination location is not blocked (someone or something isn't standing there), the spell will succeed and you will be transported.  Keep in mind that this spell only transports the caster - any pets (unless they are bonded) or friends that are with you, will be left behind.
1049559	The Gate Spell
1049560	The Gate Spell is a seventh (7th) circle spell and requires the <I>Black Pearl</I>, <I>Sullfurous Ash</I> and <I>Mandrake Root</I> <a href = "?37">reagents</a>.<BR><BR>Casting the spell will bring up a targeting cursor.  Target any previously <a href="?94">marked</a> rune, to attempt to open a magical gate to the location at which the rune was <a href="?94">marked</a>.  If the destination location is not blocked (someone or something isn't standing there), the spell will succeed and a temporary gate will open.  The gate will remain open only for a few moments before it closes again.  Anyone wishing to travel through the gate, need only to walk into the gate and they will be transported. <BR><BR>As long as your pets are following you, they too will be transported when they walk into a gate.

1049586	Refreshing Houses
1049587	To keep a house from collapsing, it must be periodically refreshed.  The actual refresh process is different, depending on the refresh type of the house.  Here is a list of all the different refresh types along with information on how a house enters the given refresh state.<BR><BR><U>Condemned</U><BR><BR>A house will be condemned when the house owner either places or accepts the transfer of a new home, or if the owner's player account becomes inactive.  Condemnation will affect all houses on all shards (except in the case of a transfer or newly placed house, in which case the last house that was acquired will not be condemned, but rather will enter into the <I>Automatic</I> refresh state. See below for details.).<BR><BR>Although the contents of a condemned house are still accessible as they normally would, the house cannot be refreshed.  In addition to not being refreshable, the house will collapse within 2 days of being condemned.  If a house entered the <I>condemned</I> status because the house owner's account became inactive, the house(s) may be uncondemned by the house owner, by openeing the front door.  Otherwise, the house can only be uncondemned by transferring or re-deeding it.<BR><BR><U>Grandfathered</U><BR><BR>These houses will be need to be manually refreshed by the house owner, one of the co-owners or house friends.  Refreshing is done by simply opening the front door.<BR><BR><U>Automatic</U><BR><BR>When an account has only one house across all shards, that house enters the <I>Automatic</I> refresh state.  These houses will never decay, unless they enter the <I>Condemned</I> state for any reason.  These houses will never have to be manually refreshed.

1049683	Followers are pets, hirelings, and constructs under your control.

On top of this, some individual followers may count as more than one follower.  For example, a dragon counts as three followers, a hireling counts as two, and a horse counts as one.  This means you could have a dragon and two horses, or two mercenaries and one horse, or any combination thereof.<br><br>Note: Some powerful creatures, such as dragons, also require Animal Taming and Animal Lore to control, regardless of the number of followers you have.

He is the ferry man of lake <I>Mortis</I>, beyond which lies the nest of the <I>The Dark Father</I> - the fountainhead of all the evil that you see around you here.<BR><BR>800 and some years ago, my sisters and I persuaded the ferry man Chyloth to take us across the lake to battle the <I>The Dark Father</I>.  My party was utterly destroyed, except for me.  For my insolence, I was cursed by the <I>The Dark Father</I> to wander these halls for eternity, unable to die - unable to leave.<BR><BR>Chyloth usually only crosses over the souls of the undead, but he can be persuaded otherwise...with a token of gold, in the form of a human skull.  Such a gem can be found only in the belly of the hellspawn known as <I>the devourer</I>.<BR><BR>I can help you summon the beast from the depths of the abyss, but I require 1000 Daemon bones to do so.  If you accept my help, I will store the Daemon bones for you until you have collected all 1000 of them.  Once the bones are collected in full, I will summon the beast for you, which you must slay to claim your prize.<BR><BR>Do you accept?
1050021	Well done brave soul.   I shall summon the beast to the circle of stones just South-East of here.  Take great care - the beast takes many forms.  Now hurry...
1050022	For your valor in combating the devourer, you have been awarded a golden skull.
1050023	You find a golden skull, but your backpack is too full to carry it.
1050024	You pick up the golden skull and quickly place it in your backpack.  Hand the skull to Chyloth the ferry man, and he will cross you over lake Mortis.
1050025	The Summoning
1050026	Find 1000 Daemon bones and hand them to Victoria as you find them.
1050027	You have accepted Victoria's help.  She requires 1000 Daemon bones to summon the devourer.<BR><BR>You may hand Victoria the bones as you collect them and she will keep count of how many you have brought her.<BR><BR>Daemon bones can be collected via various means throughout Dungeon Doom.<BR><BR>Once you have given Victoria 1000 Daemon bones, she will not return them to you if you log out or leave the dungeon.<BR>Good luck.<BR>
1050028	Victoria has accepted the Daemon bones, but the requirement is not yet met.
1050029	<I>Victoria smiles weakly at you, and begins to speak...</I><BR><BR>Well done adventurer.  You have collected all the Daemon bones necessary for me to summon <I>the devourer</I>.  I will summon him to the circle just South-East of here.  If you manage to fell the beast, you reward will be the golden skull token that you seek.<BR><BR>May luck be on your side - you shall need it.
1050030	The Daemon bones that you have thus far given to Victoria have been returned to you.
1050031	I summon forth the forces of evil from the depth of the abyss!
1050032	I COMMAND thee to appear!
1050033	The devourer lies dead, unfortunately so do you.  You cannot claim your reward while dead.  You will need to face him again.
1050034	The devourer lies dead.  Unfortunately you did not sufficiently prove your worth in combating the devourer.  Victoria shall summon another incarnation of the devourer to the circle of stones.  Try again noble adventurer.
1050035	The devourer lies dead.  Search his corpse to claim your prize!
1050036	The devourer has been summoned near the circle of stones just South-East of here.  Help slay him for your prize!
1050037	Go forth and vanquish the devourer that has been summoned!
1050038	You have already given me all the Daemon bones necessary to weave the spell.  Keep these for a later time.

1054041	"Study of the Solen Hive"
1054042	<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes, regarding you with a hopeful look in his eyes.</I><BR><BR>Um..yes..excuse me. I was wondering if you could offer me a bit of assistance. You see, I'm a naturalist of some repute - a gentleman and a scholar if you will - primarily interested in the study of insects and arachnids. While I've written a few interesting books on the marvelous Terathan race and their bizarre culture, now I've heard tales of a truly significant new discovery!<BR><BR>Apparently a race of ant-like creatures known as the Solen have appeared in our world, scuttling up from some previously hidden home. Can you believe it? Truly these are amazing times! To a scholar such as myself this is indeed an exciting opportunity.<BR><BR>That said, while I may be a genius of some reknown, sharp as a tack and quick with the quill, I'm afraid I'm not much of the adventuring type. Though I have gained assistance before, I still have many unanswered questions.<BR><BR>I am particularly interested in the Solen Egg Nests that are studiously protected by the Solen workers. If you would be so kind as to assist me, I would ask that you travel into the Solen Hive and inspect each of the Solen Egg Nests that reside within. You will have to spend some time examining each Nest before you have gathered enough information. Once you are done, report back to me and I will reward you as best as I can for your valiant efforts!<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?
1054043	Ah! This is splendid news! Each time an assistant travels into the Solen Hive to gather information for me, I feel as if I am one step closer to some grand discovery. Though I felt the same way when I was certain that Terathans had the ability to change their shape to resemble various fruits and vegetables - a point on which I am certain further study of the beasts will prove correct.<BR><BR>In any case, I cannot thank you enough! Please return to me when you have studied all the Solen Egg Nests hidden within the Solen Hive.
1054044	Find an entrance to the Solen Hive, and search within for the Solen Egg Nests. Each Nest must be studied for some time without a break in concentration in order to gather useful information.<BR><BR>Once you have completed your study of the Nests, return to the Naturalist who gave you this task.
1054045	You begin studying the Solen Egg Nest to gather information.
1054046	You abandon your study of the Solen Egg Nest without gathering the needed information.
1054047	You glance at the Egg Nest, realizing you've already studied this one.
1054048	You have studied enough Solen Egg Nests to gather a fair amount of useful information. Return to the Naturalist who gave you this task.
1054049	<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes with a frustrated look on his face.</I><BR><BR>Haven't you finished the task I appointed you yet? Gah! It's so difficult to find a good apprentice these days.<BR><BR>Remember, you must first find an entrance to the Solen Hive. Once inside, I need you to examine the Solen Egg Nests for me. When you have studied all four nests, you should have enough information to earn yourself a reward.<BR><BR>Now go on, away with you! I have piles of notes from other more helpful apprentices that I still need to study!
1054050	<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes with a pleased expression on his face.</I><BR><BR>Ah! Thank you, my goodly apprentice! These notes you have gathered will no doubt assist me in my understanding of these fascinating Solen creatures.<BR><BR>Now, since you've done such a fine job, I feel that I should give you a little reward.<BR><BR>I have a botanist friend who has discovered a strange mutation in the plants she has grown. Through science and sorcery, she has managed to produce a mutant strain of colored seeds the like of which no gardener has laid eyes upon.<BR><BR>As a reward for your fine efforts, I present you with this strange rare seed. Which reminds me, I still need to compile my notes on Solen dietary habits. They are voracious seed eaters, those Solen Matriarchs!<BR><BR>In any case, I must get back to my notes now. I give you my thanks once more, and bid a good day to you my little apprentice! If you wish to help me out again, just say the word.
1054051	<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes with an ecstatic look upon his face.</I><BR><BR>Oh my! These notes you've brought me - they say you have information on the Secret Solen Egg Nest? I've heard many tales of this secret store of special Solen Eggs, but there are many missing gaps in my notes concerning it.<BR><BR>The notes you've made here will most certainly advance my understanding of this mysterious breed of creatures!<BR><BR>Considering the amazing effort you put into your work, I feel as if I should give you something extra special as a bonus. Hrmm...<BR><BR>I have a botanist friend who has discovered a strange mutation in the plants she has grown. Through science and sorcery, she has managed to produce a rare mutant strain of colored seeds the like of which no gardener has laid eyes upon.<BR><BR>I've given a few of her seeds out to various apprentices - but I usually keep her very rare stock all for myself. They're quite amazing looking! However, since you've done such a fine job for me, I'll present you with one of these rare fire-red seeds.<BR><BR>Once again, my thanks to you! Now I really must get back to studying these notes! Take care, my fine apprentice, and come back if you wish to help me further!
1054052	<I>The Naturalist looks up from his scribbled notes.</I><BR><BR>Greetings!<BR><BR>If you're interested in helping out a scholar of some repute, I do have some work that I could use some assistance with.<BR><BR>You seem a little preoccupied with another task right now, however. Perhaps you should finish whatever it is that has your attention at the moment and return to me once you're done.
1054053	<I>The Naturalist looks at you with a friendly expression.</I><BR><BR>I see you've returned with information for me. While I'd like to finish conducting our business, it seems that you're a bit overloaded with equipment at the moment. Perhaps you'd better free up some room before we get to discussing your reward.
1054054	You have completed your study of this Solen Egg Nest. You put your notes away.
1054055	Solen Nests Studied :
1054056	You notice something very odd about this Solen Egg Nest. You begin taking notes.
1054057	You complete your examination of this bizarre Egg Nest. The Naturalist will undoubtedly be quite interested in these notes!
1054058	You begin recording your completed notes on a bit of parchment.
1054059	<I>The Solen queen considers you for a moment then says,</I><BR><BR>Hmmm... I could perhaps benefit from your assistance, but you seem to be busy with another task at the moment. Return to me when you complete whatever it is that you're working on and maybe I can still put you to good use.
1054060	<I>The Solen queen considers you eagerly for a moment then says,</I><BR><BR>Yes. Yes, I think you could be of use. Normally, of course, I would handle these things on my own, but these are busy times. Much to do, much to do. And besides, if I am to one day become the Matriarch, then it will be good to have experience trusting others to carry out various tasks for me. Yes.<BR><BR>That is my plan, you see - I will become the next Matriarch. Our current Matriarch is fine and all, but she won't be around forever. And when she steps down, I intend to be the next in line. Ruling others is my destiny, you see.<BR><BR>What I ask of you is quite simple. First, I need you to remove some of the - well - competition, I suppose. Though I dare say most are hardly competent to live up to such a title. I'm referring to the other queens of this colony, of course. My dear sisters, so to speak. If you could remove 5 of them, I would be most pleased. *sighs* By remove, I mean kill them. Don't make that face at me - this is how things work in a proper society, and ours has been more proper than most since the dawn of time. It's them or me, and whenever I give it any thought, I'm quite sure I'd prefer it to be them.<BR><BR>I also need you to gather some zoogi fungus for me - 50 should do the trick.<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?
1054061	<I>The Solen queen smiles as you decide to help her.</I><BR><BR>Excellent. We'll worry about the zoogi fungus later - start by eliminating 5 queens from my colony.<BR><BR>That part's important, by the way; they must be queens from my colony. Killing queens from the other solen colony does little to help me become Matriarch of this colony and will not count toward your task.<BR><BR>Oh, and none of those nasty infiltrator queens either. They perform a necessary duty, I suppose, spying on the other colony. I fail to see why that couldn't be left totally to the warriors, though. Nevertheless, they do not count as well.<BR><BR>Very well. Carry on. I'll be waiting for your return.
1054062	Kill 5 red solen queens.
1054063	Kill 5 black solen queens.
1054064	Red Solen Queens killed:
1054065	Black Solen Queens killed:
1054066	<I>The Solen queen looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>You're back, but you have not yet eliminated 5 queens from my colony. Return when you have completed this task.<BR><BR>Remember, by the way, that queens from the other solen colony and infiltrator queens do not count toward your task.<BR><BR>Very well. Carry on. I'll be waiting for your return.
1054067	You've completed your task of slaying solen queens. Return to the ambitious queen who asked for your help.
1054068	<I>The Solen queen looks pleased to see you.</I><BR><BR>Splendid! You've done quite well in reducing my competition to become the next Matriarch. Now I must ask that you gather some zoogi fungus for me. I must practice processing it into powder of translocation.<BR><BR>I believe the amount we agreed upon earlier was 50. Please return when you have that amount and then give them to me.<BR><BR>Farewell for now.
1054069	Gather zoogi fungus until you have 50 of them, then give them to the ambitious queen you are helping.
1054070	<I>The Solen queen looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>Do you have the zoogi fungus?<BR><BR>If so, give them to me. Otherwise, go gather some and then return to me.
1054071	I have not asked you to bring me any zoogi fungus, therefore I cannot accept these.
1054072	Our arrangement was for 50 of the zoogi fungus. Please return to me when you have that amount.
1054073	<I>The Solen queen smiles as she takes the zoogi fungus from you.</I><BR><BR>Wonderful! I greatly appreciate your help with these tasks. My plans are beginning to take shape ensuring that I will be the next Matriarch. But there is still much to be done until then.<BR><BR>You've done what I've asked of you and for that I thank you. Please accept this bag of sending and some powder of translocation as a reward. Oh, and I suppose I should give you some gold as well. Yes, yes. Of course.
1054074	You have been given a bag of sending.
1054075	You have been given some powder of translocation.
1054076	You have been given some gold.
1054077	<I>The Solen queen looks at you with a smile.</I><BR><BR>While I'd like to finish conducting our business, it seems that you're a bit overloaded with equipment at the moment.<BR><BR>Perhaps you should free some room in your backpack before we proceed.
1054078	<I>The Solen queen looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>Ah good, you've returned. I will conclude our business by giving you any remaining rewards I owe you for aiding me.
1054079	<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles as she eats the seed you offered.</I><BR><BR>Thank you for that seed. It was quite delicious.  <BR><BR>I would offer to make you a friend of my colony, but you seem to be busy with another task at the moment. Perhaps you should finish whatever is occupying your attention at the moment and return to me once you're done.
1054080	Thank you for that plant seed. Those have such wonderful flavor.
1054081	<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles as you greet her.</I><BR><BR>It is good to see you again. I would offer to process some zoogi fungus for you, but you seem to be busy with another task at the moment. Perhaps you should finish whatever is occupying your attention at the moment and return to me once you're done.
1054082	<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles happily as she eats the seed you offered.</I><BR><BR>I think you for that seed. I was quite delicious. So full of flavor.<BR><BR>Hmm... if you would like, I could make you a friend of my colony. This would stop the warriors, workers, and queens of my colony from thinking you are an intruder, thus they would not attack you. In addition, as a friend of my colony I will process zoogi fungus into powder of translocation for you.<BR><BR>To become a friend of my colony, I ask that you complete a couple tasks for me. These are the same tasks I will ask of you when you wish me to process zoogi fungus, by the way.<BR><BR>First, I would like for you to eliminate some infiltrators from the other solen colony. They are spying on my colony, and I fear for the safety of my people. They must be slain.<BR><BR>After that, I must ask that you gather some water for me. Our water supplies are inadequate, so we must try to supplement our reserve using water vats here in our lair.<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?
1054083	<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles happily as you greet her.</I><BR><BR>Hello again. It is always good to see a friend of our colony.<BR><BR>Would you like me to process some zoogi fungus into powder of translocation for you? I would be happy to do so if you will first undertake a couple tasks for me.<BR><BR>First, I would like for you to eliminate some infiltrators from the other solen colony. They are spying on my colony, and I fear for the safety of my people. They must be slain.<BR><BR>After that, I must ask that you gather some water for me. Our water supplies are inadequate, so we must try to supplement our reserve using water vats here in our lair.<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?
1054084	<I>The Solen Matriarch looks pleased that you've accepted.</I><BR><BR>Very good. Please start by hunting some infiltrators from the other solen colony and eliminating them. Slay 7 of them and then return to me.<BR><BR>Farewell for now and good hunting.
1054085	Kill 7 red solen infiltrators.
1054086	Kill 7 black solen infiltrators.
1054087	Red Solen Infiltrators killed:
1054088	Black Solen Infiltrators killed:
1054089	<I>The Solen Matriarch looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>You're back, but you have not yet eliminated 7 infiltrators from the enemy colony. Return when you have completed this task.<BR><BR>Carry on. I'll be waiting for your return.
1054090	You've completed your task of slaying solen infiltrators. Return to the Matriarch who gave you this task.
1054091	<I>The Solen Matriarch nods favorably as you approach her.</I><BR><BR>Marvelous! I'm impressed at your ability to hunt and kill enemies for me. My colony is thankful.<BR><BR>Now I must ask that you gather some water for me. A standard pitcher of water holds approximately one gallon. Please decant 8 gallons of fresh water into our water vats.<BR><BR>Farewell for now.
1054092	Gather 8 gallons of water for the water vats of the solen ant lair.
1054093	Gallons of Water gathered:
1054094	<I>The Solen Matriarch looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>You're back, but you have not yet gathered 8 gallons of water. Return when you have completed this task.<BR><BR>Carry on. I'll be waiting for your return.
1054095	You've completed your task of gathering water. Return to the Matriarch who gave you this task.
1054096	<I>The Solen Matriarch listens as you report the completion of your tasks to her.</I><BR><BR>I give you my thanks for your help, and I will gladly make you a friend of my solen colony. My warriors, workers, and queens will not longer look at you as an intruder and attack you when you enter our lair.<BR><BR>I will also process some zoogi fungus into powder of translocation for you. Two of the zoogi fungi are required for each measure of the powder. I will process up to 200 zoogi fungi into 100 measures of powder of translocation.<BR><BR>I will also give you some gold for assisting me and my colony, but first let's take care of your zoogi fungus.
1054097	<I>The Solen Matriarch listens as you report the completion of your tasks to her.</I><BR><BR>I give you my thanks for your help, and I will gladly process some zoogi fungus into powder of translocation for you. Two of the zoogi fungi are required for each measure of the powder. I will process up to 200 zoogi fungi into 100 measures of powder of translocation.<BR><BR>I will also give you some gold for assisting me and my colony, but first let's take care of your zoogi fungus.
1054098	Give the Solen Matriarch a stack of zoogi fungus to process into powder of translocation.
1054099	<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles as you greet her.</I><BR><BR>I will gladly process some zoogi fungus into powder of translocation for you. Two of the zoogi fungi are required for each measure of the powder. I will process up to 200 zoogi fungi into 100 measures of powder of translocation.
1054100	You receive some powder of translocation.
1054101	<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles as you greet her.</I><BR><BR>Ah good, you've returned. I will conclude our business by giving you gold I owe you for aiding me.
1054102	<I>The Solen Matriarch looks at you with a smile.</I><BR><BR>While I'd like to finish conducting our business, it seems that you're a bit overloaded with equipment at the moment.<BR><BR>Perhaps you should free some room in your backpack before we proceed.

1055000	<I>The ancient, wrinkled hag looks up from her vile-smelling cauldron.  Her single, unblinking eye attempts to focus in on you, but to little avail.</I><BR><BR>What's that?  Who's there?  What do you want with me?  I don't have time for the likes of you.  I have stews to spice and brews to boil.  Too many things to complete to be helping out a stranger.<BR><BR>Besides, it looks as if you've already got yourself a quest that needs doing.  Perhaps if you finish the task you're on, you can return to me and I'll help you out.  But until then, leave an old witch alone to her magics!  Shoo!  Away with ye!<BR><BR><I>The witch rushes you off with a wave of her decrepit hand and returns to tending the noxious brew boiling in her cauldron.</I>
1055001	<I>The ancient, wrinkled hag looks up from her vile-smelling cauldron.  Her single, unblinking eye attempts to focus in on you, but to little avail.</I><BR><BR>Eh? Who is it? Who's there?  Come to trouble an old woman have you?<BR><BR>I'll split ye open and swallow yer guts!  I'll turn ye into a pile o' goo, I will!  Bah!  As if I didn't have enough to worry about.  As if I've not enough trouble as it is!<BR><BR>Another of my blasted apprentices has gone missing!  Foolish children, think they know everything.  I should turn the lot of them into toads - if only they'd return with their task complete!  But that's the trouble, innit?  They never return!<BR><BR>But you don't care, do ye?  I suppose you're another one of those meddlesome kids, come to ask me for something?  Eh?  Is that it?  You want something from me, expect me to hand it over?  I've enough troubles with my apprentices, and that vile imp, Zeefzorpul!  Why, I bet it's him who's got the lot of them!  And who knows what he's done?  Vile little thing.<BR><BR>If you expect me to help you with your silly little desires, you'll be doing something for me first, eh?  I expect you to go seek out my apprentice.  I sent him along the road west of here up towards Yew's graveyard, but he never came back. Find him, and bring him back, and I'll give you a little reward that I'm sure you'll find pleasant.<BR><BR>But I tells ye to watch out for the imp name've Zeefzorpul!  He's a despicable little beast who likes to fool and fiddle with folk and generally make life miserable for everyone.  If ye get him on your bad side, you're sure to end up ruing the day ye were born. As if you didn't already, with an ugly mug like that!<BR><BR>Well, you little whelp?  Going to help an old hag or not?
1055002	<I>Somewhat out of character for the vile old witch, she actually seems delighted that you've accepted her offer.</I><BR><BR>Ah! That's the spirit! You're not a useless bag of bones after all, are ye?  Well then, best get your hind quarters in gear and head towards the road!  Remember, my young Apprentice could be anywhere along the road heading towards the Yew Graveyard, so be sure to run the whole course of it, and stay on track!<BR><BR>And for Gashnak's sake, come back here when you've found something! And remember, I don't have all day!  And watch out for the imp Zeefzorpul!  And don't return empty handed!  And pack a warm sweater!  And don't trample my lawn on the way out!<BR><BR>What are you still doing here?  Get to it!  Shoo!
1055003	<I>The wrinkled hag looks up at you with venom in her eyes.</I><BR><BR>What're you doing back here?  I thought I told you to go find my lost Apprentice!  I don't have time for your laziness, you wretched little worm!  Shoo! Away with ye! And don't come back until you've found out what's happened to my Apprentice!
1055004	You inspect the charred and bloodied corpse, recognizing it from the Hag's description as the lost Apprentice you were tasked to bring back.<BR><BR>It appears as if he has been scorched by fire and magic, and scratched at with vicious claws.<BR><BR>You wonder if this horrific act is the work of the vile imp Zeefzorpul of which the Hag spoke.  You decide you'd best return to the Hag and report your findings.
1055005	<I>The wrinkled old Hag looks up from her cauldron of boiling innards.</I><BR><BR>Bah!  Back already?  Can't you see I'm busy with my cooking?  You wouldn't like to have a little taste of my delicious dragon gizzard soup, would you?  Haw! I thought as much.<BR><BR>Enough of this jibber-jabber then - what news of my Apprentice?<BR><BR>What's that?  You say that horrible little imp Zeefzorpul was behind his disappearance!?  What would Zeefzorpul want with my Apprentice?  Probably just wants to make life more miserable for me than it already is.<BR><BR>Wait! Bah! That must be it! Zeefzorpul must have found out that I sent my Apprentices out with various Magic Brew Recipes - lists of tasks and ingredients that needed completing.<BR><BR>That despicable Zeefzorpul knows I need the list of ingredients I gave to that Apprentice.  I've recipes to mix, stews to boil, magics to cast, and fortunes to meddle!  I won't let that wretched felchscum spoil my day.  You then, I need you to go find Zeefzorpul and get that scrap of parchment back!<BR><BR>I'm not sure where he bides his time, but I'm sure if you go find his imp friends and rough them up, they'll squeal on him in no time!  They all know each others' secret hiding places.  Go on!  Shoo! Go slay a few imps until they cough up their secrets!  No mercy for those little nasties!
1055006	<I>The sickly old hag looks up from her boiling cauldron.</I><BR><BR>Have you found that vile little Zeefzorpul yet?  What!?  You've come back here without finding out where Zeefzorpul is, and what he's done with my Magic Brew Recipe?<BR><BR>I told you what needs to be done, you little whelp!  Now away with ye!  And don't you return until you've found my list of ingredients!
1055007	<I>The wretched imp cries out for mercy.</I><BR><BR>Forgive me! You master! You great warrior, great hooman, great greatest! Forgive! Forgive! I give up Zeef! He no good any way!  He always smack me head and hurt me good!  He say I ugly too, even with me pretty teef!<BR><BR>But I knows where he hide!  I follow him flapping to his hidey hole.  He think he so smart but he so wrong!  I make scribble drawing of where he like to hide!  But you need the whistle blower to make him come!  He no come without it!  Make with the whistle at his hidey place, and Zeef must come, he cannot resist!<BR><BR><I>The frightened imp hands you a crumpled map and a strange flute.</I><BR><BR>You go to where the picture shows and then you play that whistle!  Zeef come, me promise!  But you make promise that you smack Zeef head good!  Pweese?<BR><BR><I>With this last request, the miserable little imp falls and breathes no more.</I>
1055008	<I>In a puff of smoke that smells of brimstone, the imp Zeefzorpul appears.</I><BR><BR>Wuh-whut!? How did stupid hooman find mighty Zeefzorpul?  This crazy many times!  This crazy not possible! This big crazy with crazy on top!  But it happening!  How can it be true!?<BR><BR>GAH! Even mighty Zeefzorpul can no resist that crazy music!  Mighty Zeefzorpul do what you want!  Have you stupid paper back!  Mighty Zeefzorpul no want it any way.  It dumb.  It super dumb.  Big dumb like stupid dumb tree with dumb things on it!  So stupid!  So dumb that mighty Zeefzorpul not even care!  You see me not caring?  You better cause it certainly happening!  Me not caring one bit!<BR><BR><I>The strange little imp tosses the piece of parchment at you.  Much to your surprise, however, he swoops down in a flash of flapping wings and steals the Magic Flute from your grasp.</I><BR><BR>Hah! So stupid like a hooman!  Mighty Zeefzorpul has defeated stupid hooman and is greatest ever imp in world!  You serious stupid, mister hooman.  Big stupid with stupid on top.  Now you no can make trick on me again with crazy dance music!  Mighty Zeefzorpul fly away to his other secret home where you never find him again!<BR><BR>Me hope you get eated by a troll!<BR><BR><I>With that, the imp Zeefzorpul disappears in another puff of rancid smoke.</I>
1055009	<I>The wart-covered witch looks up from pouring fetid scraps of meat into her cauldron.</I><BR><BR>You've dealt with that troublesome imp Zeefzorpul?  Good for you, little one!  You're not as useless as you appear, even to a daft old wench such as myself!<BR><BR>Now then, I see you've recovered my precious Magic Brew Recipe.  I suppose you expect a reward?  Well, you can go on expecting, and I can go on being ugly.  What good is it to me that I have the list, if I don't have an apprentice to go gather the ingredients and perform the tasks themselves!<BR><BR>If you want your precious little reward, you'll have to complete the task I gave to my previous Apprentice.  Now away with you!  Shoo! Shimmy! Skedattle!  I've heads to boil and stews to spice!  Don't you return until you've completed every item on that list!
1055010	<I>The bawdy old pirate captain looks up from his bottle of Wild Harpy whiskey, as drunk as any man you've ever seen.<BR><BR>With an excruciatingly slow movement, he pushes back his tricorne hat and stares you down with red-rimmed eyes.</I><BR><BR>Whut tha blazes do ye want, landlubber?  Some've Captain Blackheart's fine Whiskey?  Well ye can drown in the seven seas, ya barnacle-covered bilge rat!<BR><BR>I've cut down pasty-faced runts like yerself for lesser insults!  I've sailed the seas've this world fer fifty years, and never seen a more milk-soaked pansy lass than ye come in here for a favor.  Give ye some of my special Whiskey?  I'd sooner wrestle a sea serpent naked - and I've done that some twenty times!<BR><BR>Ye see, ol' Captain Blackheart's Whiskey is only for pirate folk.  And ye don't look like no pirate I've ever seen.  Ye have te have the right cut of cloth and the right amount of liquor in yer belly te sail on my crew!  And without that, ye might as well go home and cry to yer mommy.  Cause ye ain't ever gonna share no drink with me!<BR><BR>Now off with ye!<BR><BR><I>With that, Captain Blackheart goes back to singing his bawdy songs and drinking his whiskey.  It seems as if you'll have to find some way to change his mind about your worthiness.</I>
1055011	<I>The drunken pirate, Captain Blackheart, looks up from his bottle of whiskey with a pleased expression.</I><BR><BR>Well looky here!  I didn't think a landlubber like yourself had the pirate blood in ye!  But look at that!  You certainly look the part now!  Sure you can still keep on your feet?  Har!<BR><BR>Avast ye, ye loveable pirate!  Ye deserve a belt of better brew than the slop ye've been drinking, and I've just the thing.<BR><BR>I call it Captain Blackheart's Whiskey, and it'll give ye hairs on yer chest, that's for sure.  Why, a keg of this stuff once spilled on my ship, and it ate a hole right through the deck!<BR><BR>Go on, drink up, or use it to clean the rust off your cutlass - it's the best brew, either way!<BR><BR><I>Captain Blackheart hands you a jug of his famous Whiskey. You think it best to return it to the Hag, rather than drink any of the noxious swill.</I>
1055012	<I>The ancient crone looks up from her bubbling brew, staring you down with her one good eye.</I><BR><BR>You've returned already have you?  And what of your task?  Have you gathered all the needed ingredients?<BR><BR>What's that!?  You still haven't finished the simple little task I've set before you?  Then why come back here and bother me?  I can't get a single brew concocted if you keep bugging me with your whimpering little diatribes!  Why, you're worse than my last apprentice - and he was the very king of fools!<BR><BR>Go on with ye!  Away and begone!  I don't want to see hide nor hair of your whining little face until you've gathered each and every last one of the ingredients on that list!<BR><BR><I>With a disgusting hacking noise, the vile witch spits upon the ground and brushes you off with a wave of her wrinkled old hand.</I>
1055013	<I>The horrible wretch of a witch looks up from her vile experiments and focuses her one good eye on you.</I><BR><BR>Eh?  What's that?  You say you've gathered the ingredients for my delicious Magic Brew?<BR><BR>Well, well, I don't know exactly what to say.  I thought for sure you'd end up dead!  Haw!  Can't blame a lady for wishing, can you?  Even if she is a bit old and wrinkled.<BR><BR>Well, I promised you a reward for your efforts, and I never lie - leastways not to someone like you, after the great sacrifices you've made.  You know, I could use a new Apprentice, in an official capacity as it were.  I couldn't convince you to stay around and help me out some more could I?  There's always cauldrons that need cleaning, dung that needs shoveling, newts eye that needs a proper chewing, and fires that need stoking.<BR><BR>What's that? Not interested?  Well, I suppose you have great things ahead of you and all that. Feh! Like a puckish little puke like you could ever make something of themselves in this cold old world!<BR><BR>Nevertheless, I'll give you your blasted reward, and you'd better be happy with it because it's all you're getting.  Caused me enough trouble as it is.  Here, take it, and be off with you!  It'll be a pleasure to my eye if I never have to squint to see you again!  And the stench!  Smells like you washed this very morning!  A great fancy folk you are, with your soaps and water!  Think you're so great...why, I remember when we didn't even have soap, and water was made by tiny little fairies and cost a gold piece for a thimbleful...I could tell you some stories, I could...<BR><BR><I>Your reward in hand, you decide to leave the old Hag to her mumblings before she realizes you're still around and puts you back to work.</I>

1055054	<I>The bawdy old pirate captain looks up from his bottle of Wild Harpy whiskey, as drunk as any man you've ever seen.</I><BR><BR>Avast ye, ye loveable pirate!  Just in from sailin' the glorious sea?  Ye look right ready te fall down on the spot, ye do!<BR><BR>I tell ye what, from the look've ye, ye deserve a belt of better brew than the slop ye've been drinking, and I've just the thing.<BR><BR>I call it Captain Blackheart's Whiskey, and it'll give ye hairs on yer chest, that's for sure.  Why, a keg of this stuff once spilled on my ship, and it ate a hole right through the deck!<BR><BR>Go on, drink up, or use it to clean the rust off your cutlass - it's the best brew, either way!<BR><BR><I>Captain Blackheart hands you a jug of his famous Whiskey. You think it best to return it to the Hag, rather than drink any of the noxious swill.</I>
1055055	You are still attempting to obtain a jug of Captain Blackheart's Whiskey, but the drunkard Captain refuses to share his unique brew.  You must prove your worthiness as a pirate to Blackheart before he'll offer you a jug.
1055056	<I>The inebriated pirate looks up at you with a wry grin.</I><BR><BR>Well hello again, me little matey.  I see ye have a belly full of rotgut in ye.  I bet ye think you're a right hero, ready te face the world.  But as I told ye before, bein' a member of my pirate crew means more'n just being able to hold yer drink.  Ye have te look the part - and frankly, me little barnacle, ye don't have the cut of cloth te fit in with the crowd I like te hang around.<BR><BR>So scurry off, ye wee sewer rat, and don't come back round these parts all liquored up an' three sheets te tha wind, unless yer truly ready te join me pirate crew!<BR><BR><I>Captain Blackheart shoves you aside, banging his cutlass against the table as he calls to the waitress for another round.</I>
1055057	<I>Captain Blackheart looks up from polishing his cutlass, glaring at you with red-rimmed eyes.</I><BR><BR>Well, well.  Lookit the wee little deck swabby.  Aren't ye a cute lil' lassy?  Don't ye look just fancy?  Ye think yer ready te join me pirate crew?  Ye think I should offer ye some've me special Blackheart brew?<BR><BR>I'll make ye walk the plank, I will!  We'll see how sweet n' darlin' ye look when the sea serpents get at ye and rip ye te threads!  Won't that be a pretty picture, eh?<BR><BR>Ye don't have the stomach fer the pirate life, that's plain enough te me.  Ye prance around here like a wee lil' princess, ye do.  If ye want to join my crew ye can't just look tha part - ye have to have the stomach fer it, filled up with rotgut until ye can't see straight.  I don't drink with just any ol' landlubber!  Ye'd best prove yer mettle before ye talk te me again!<BR><BR><I>The drunken pirate captain leans back in his chair, taking another gulp of his drink before he starts in on another bawdy pirate song.</I>
1055058	<I>Captain Blackheart looks up from his drink, almost tipping over his chair as he looks you up and down.</I><BR><BR>You again?  I thought I told ye te get lost?  Go on with ye!  Ye ain't no pirate - yer not even fit te clean the barnacles off me rear end!

Ye might think ye can test me meddle with a sip or two of yer dandy wine, but a real pirate walks the decks with a belly full of it.  Lookit that, yer not even wobblin'!<BR><BR>Ye've impressed me a bit, ye wee tyke, but it'll take more'n that te join me crew!<BR><BR><I>Captain Blackheart tips his mug in your direction, offering up a jolly laugh, but it seems you still haven't impressed him enough.</I>

You say you've gathered the ingredients for my delicious Magic Brew?<BR><BR>Well now, my little one, I'd like to discuss your reward with you, but it seems you won't have enough room to carry it even if I do provide you with your treat.  Perhaps you'd best remove some items from that overstuffed pack of yours and talk to me when you're ready.<BR><BR><I>The witch goes back to stirring the contents of her bubbling cauldron.  You'd best make room in your pack for the Hag's reward before speaking to her again.</I>

Listen, you little wretch, I'm in no mood for any of your meddlesome requests. I've work to do, and no time for your whining.<BR><BR>Come back later, and maybe I'll have something for you to do.

1055080	<I>Elwood looks up from his ale as you greet him.</I><BR><BR>What's that? Who me? No, no. You must be looking for someone else.
1055081	<I>Elwood greets you warmly, like an old friend he's not quite sure he ever had.</I><BR><BR>Hello. Yes. Sit down. Please. Good. Okay, stand. Up to you.<BR><BR>So, what brings you to these parts... hey, wait. Just had a thought. Would you like to do me a favor? Yes, really. You know, for old times sake. The good ole days. You were always one of my best suppliers. Or maybe you weren't, who knows any more. Anyway, could use some help supplementing my stock. You know me. Always looking for something new to add to the collection. Or sometimes not so new - just more of the same. But don't have to tell you that. You know, don't you. Yes. Just like old times. That's what it'll be. You and me - together again. Ah, it's been too long.<BR><BR>So what do you think? The fee will be the same as always. I'm a fair man. You know that. So what do you say?
1055082	<I>Elwood looks a bit flustered and nearly knocks over his bottle of ale.</I><BR><BR>Well, I see. It's like that, is it? Yes. Well then. Okay. You've changed. Yes. Yes, you have. Something's changed. I know I haven't. Not me. Not good ole Elwood.<BR><BR><I>Elwood trails off, though you can still hear him muttering softly.</I>
1055083	<I>Elwood slaps his knee and grins at you.</I><BR><BR>Yes. Yes. That's the spirit. I knew it. Knew it when I first saw you. You remind me so much of your dear departed father. Or someone. Not sure. Maybe no one. But that's okay. Ah, good times.<BR><BR>Anyway, so as you know, I'm a collector. Got all kinds of interesting things laying around back at my warehouse. You know. You've seen it. Haven't you? Yes? No? Nevermind. Not important.<BR><BR>Right. So, always trying to add new things to my collection. Or sometimes just get more of something. Can't have too many. Right? Yeah? Sure.<BR><BR>Let's see. Where to start. Oh, I know. Pearls. Yes. But not just any pearls. Rainbow pearls. Yes. From the lake here in Haven. Seems all that magic Uzeraan was throwing around when he transformed the island had an interesting effect on some of the shellfish down there. Exactly, rainbow pearls. Useless for magic, but an item worth collecting. Trust me on this. Trust me.<BR><BR>Need you to go fish some up for me. Down at the lake. Lake Haven. Off ya go. Happy fishing!<BR><BR><I>Elwood turns back to his ale and now seems oblivious to you.</I>
1055084	Fish up shellfish from Lake Haven and collect rainbow pearls.
1055085	Rainbow pearls collected: 
1055086	You pull a shellfish out of the water, and find a rainbow pearl inside of it.
1055087	You pull a shellfish out of the water, but it doesn't have a rainbow pearl.
1055088	You've collected enough rainbow pearls. Speak to Elwood to give them to him and get your next task.
1055089	<I>Elwood looks up as you tap him on the shoulder.</I><BR><BR>Good. Good. You're back. Wait. You don't have the rainbow pearls I need. Taking a break? Yeah. Sure. There's no hurry. Let me know when you've got all those pearls, though. I'll be here.
1055090	<I>Elwood jumps slightly when you call his name.</I><BR><BR>What. I'm awake. Oh, It's you. Hey, look at those pearls. Beautiful. Wow. Where'd you get those... oh right. I sent you to get them. From the lake. Lake Haven. Great job. Gotta love rainbow pearls. Oooh, Colors.<BR><BR>Okay, let's see. Next. Need a painting. Go to the Colored Canvas and speak to Alberta. Alberta Giacco. Best painter I've ever met. Ask her to do a painting of you. Yes. Of you. A portrait. Never know if you might up and become famous one day. Need to have a painting of you in my collection. From now. Before all the fame. Go. Alberta awaits. She's in Vesper.<BR><BR><I>Elwood starts playing with the pearls you brought him and seems to have forgotten you're there.</I>
1055091	Go to Vesper and speak to Alberta Giacco at the Colored Canvas.
1055092	<I>Alberta looks up from the painting she is working on and faces you.</I><BR><BR>Excuse me. I don't mean to be rude, but I'm in the middle of something, and can't... oh wait, I see. You must be the one Elwood sent over.<BR><BR>Very well. If you'll have a seat on the stool over there, we'll get started. This will just take a few seconds. I paint quite quickly, you see. I'll start once you are seated.<BR><BR><I>Alberta exchanges the painting she was working on for a blank canvas.</I>
1055093	Sit on the stool in front of Alberta's easel so that she can paint your portrait. You'll need to sit there for about 30 seconds.
1055094	<I>Elwood yawns and stretches, then focuses his gaze on you.</I><BR><BR>Hello. Do I know you? Hold on a second. Yes. Yes, I do. You were going to bring me some rainbow pearls. Wait. No. You already did that. I remember now. Right. So go get that portrait painted. Alberta is in Vesper. Go to her. Alberta Giacco. Come back when she's done.
1055095	You must remain seated on the stool until the portrait is complete. Alberta will now have to start again with a fresh canvas.
1055096	<I>Alberta looks at you sympathetically.</I><BR><BR>Don't worry, this will only take a few seconds. I realize that stool can be uncomfortable, and I apologize for that. Perhaps I should replace it with a more comfortable chair. But then again, it's that very discomfort that helps produce such wonderful facial expressions for my paintings. Ah well.
1055097	<I>Elwood drums his fingers on the counter then looks up at you expectantly.</I><BR><BR>Ah, finally. I'm famished. This so-called tavern doesn't even serve pizza, so one must have it delivered. It's an outrage. Er... wait. Where's my pizza? Yes, my pizza. What kind of delivery is this? Didn't even bring my pizza. This will severely impact your tip, I'm afraid.<BR><BR>Hold on a moment. You were helping me with something else, weren't you? Ah. Yes. I've got it now. You were to have a portrait done. Well. Good. Yes. But let's not dawdle. Off you go. If you happen to see anyone with my pizza, please insist they hurry.<BR><BR>
1055098	<I>Alberta stands back from the canvas and surveys her work.</I><BR><BR>Not too bad. Quite good even, if I do say so myself. As always, of course.<BR><BR>Oh, you're still here. Please let Elwood know that the painting has been completed. I'll have it sent to him once it dries.<BR><BR><I>Alberta removes the portrait from her easel and sets it aside to dry.</I>
1055099	Return to Elwood and let him know that the painting is complete.
1055100	<I>Elwood notices you immediately and waves you over.</I><BR><BR>You're back. Good. That's good. Hmm. You don't seem to have that painting yet. Don't tell me Alberta refused. That's no good. I made her what she is! She was living in the gutter when I found her. The gutter. And she has the... what's that? Oh, she finished the portrait. Right. Good. Can always count on Alberta. Always. Best painter in the land.<BR><BR>Just have a couple... er... wait... make that... two more task for you. Then our business will be concluded. For now. Old chums like us will always work together again. Yes. We go so far back. Right. I think.<BR><BR>Anyway. There's a musician. A minstrel. His name's Gabriel Piete. Quite the good singer. One of my favorites. Absolute favorite. What I'd like is his autograph. Simple. Just his autograph. You're likely to find him at the Conservatory of Music in Britain. He's often there. Often. Between performances. Hurry now. There ya go.<BR><BR><I>Elwood falls silent though his lips are still  moving. It looks like he's quietly repeating the word, "autograph."</I>
1055101	Go to Britain and obtain the autograph of renowned minstrel, Gabriel Piete. He is often found at the Conservatory of Music.
1055102	<I>Alberta stops cleaning her brushes and looks your way.</I><BR><BR>Don't worry, I'll send the painting to Elwood once it's dry. Please let him know that the painting has been finished.
1055103	<I>Gabriel sighs loudly as you address him and stops whatever it was that he was doing.</I><BR><BR>WHAT?!? Can you not see that I'm working here?  Ugh, sometimes I wish they'd just lock the outer doors to anyone who doesn't belong here. So go ahead and fawn. Get it over with, and then leave. Sooner you're out of here, the sooner I'm back to work.<BR><BR>I see. So you want an autograph. Fine. If it'll get rid of you, I'll give you my autograph. But I'll only sign some sheet music for one of my songs. Until then, please let me get back to work.<BR><BR>You can probably find some of my sheet music at one of the theaters in the land. When I perform there, they often sell it as a souvenir. Speak to the impresario... the theater manager. My last three performances were in Nujel'm, Jhelom, and here in Britian.
1055104	Find some sheet music for one of Gabriel's songs. Try speaking to an impresario from one of the theaters in the land.
1055105	<I>Elwood jumps and almost falls from his stool when you tap his shoulder.</I><BR><BR>Oh my. Don't do that. Scared me half to death. Sneaking up on people like that. I don't even know you. Yes, I do. I do know you. Ordered a pizza from you and never received it. I'm rather miffed about that.<BR><BR>No. No. Wait. Of course. Not the pizza. You're here with the moonfire brew I wanted. Magical moonfire brew. Not sure what it is. Just want some.<BR><BR>What's that? Oh. The autograph. Gabriel Piete. Yes. Of course. Do you have it? No. Well. Hmm. Don't sneak up on people like that. Not polite.
1055106	Sheet music for a Gabriel Piete song? No, I'm sorry, but we've run out. We might get some more after he performs here again, but right now we don't have any. My apologies.
1055107	Sure, I have some sheet music for a Gabriel Piete song. I'd be happy to sell you a copy for 10 gold.
1055108	You don't have enough gold to buy the sheet music.
1055109	The theater impresario hands you some sheet of music for one of Gabriel Piete's songs.
1055110	Speak to Gabriel to have him autograph the sheet music.
1055111	<I>Gabriel does not look happy to see you.</I><BR><BR>Do you have any sheet music? No. Please return when you do, but until then please leave me to my work.
1055112	<I>Elwood seems to be studying the bottom of his bottle of ale as you approach.</I><BR><BR>What's this? Strange. Quite strange. I could have sworn I was drinking wine.<BR><BR>Oh, hello. Yes. Good to see you. Any luck with that autograph?  Bet you thought I'd forgotten. No. Not me. Mind like a steel trap. Can't get it open no matter how hard you try. Or something. No luck yet? Ah well. keep trying. I have faith in you. Whoever you are.
1055113	<I>Gabriel looks up impatiently as you approach.</I><BR><BR>Good. We can finally be done with one another. Here, let me sign that and have this business completed.<BR><BR><I>Gabriel takes the sheet music, autographs it, and then hands it back to you.</I>
1055114	Speak to Elwood to give him the autographed sheet music.
1055115	<I>Elwood scratches his ear then notices you.</I><BR><BR>Good day. What brings you to the Albatross? Me? An autograph? You want my autograph? Well, I suppose. What's that? Oh. Yes. Gabriel Piete. Yes. Get his autograph and return to me. Good day.
1055116	<I>Elwood looks up eagerly as you tell him about the autographed sheet music.</I><BR><BR>Quite good work. Not an easy one to deal with, that one. Gabriel Piete. Yes. Well done. Nice autograph.<BR><BR>One last task. I would like a set of toy monster figurines made by the famous toymaker, Tomas O'Neerlan. You'll find him in Trinsic. He's often at the Tinker's Guild. Try looking there.<BR><BR>You're doing quite well. Quite well indeed. Knew you would. Just like old times. Yes. Quite good.
1055117	Go to Trinsic and speak to Tomas O'Neerlan, the famous toymaker.
1055118	<I>Gabriel ignores you.</I>
1055119	<I>Tomas smiles freely as you speak to him.</I><BR><BR>Ah, to be sure I can make you some toy monster figurines. That's my work, making toys. Worry not, we'll put together a good set of monsters for you and your figurines.<BR><BR>But I'll be needing something from you before I can begin. Here, take these enchanted paints. Using them, you can capture a set of images of the creatures you wish me to make into toys. It'll only work on the group of creatures I select for your set of figurines. Oh, and I'll be needing those enchanted paints back when all is said and done.<BR><BR>
1055120	Use the enchanted paints to capture the image of all of the creatures listed below.
1055121	Complete
1055122	Incomplete
1055123	<I>You watch as Elwood spins around blissfully on his stool.</I><BR><BR>Oh. Forgive me. Didn't see you there. Whoo. Dizzy. Can't see straight. Have you gotten those figurines yet? No. Ah. Not to worry. Keep at it. No doubt you'll come through with those.<BR><BR>Excuse me a moment. I think I need to sit down. Wait. I am sitting down. Good then. Yes. Sitting down.<BR><BR><I>Elwood reaches out and takes hold of the counter as if to steady himself.</I>
1055124	You have no interest in capturing the image of this creature.
1055125	The enchanted paints swirl for a moment then an image begins to take shape. *Click*

1055127	a painted image
1055128	You now have all of the creature images you need. Return to Tomas O'Neerlan so that he can make the toy figurines.
1055129	<I>Tomas greets you warmly as you approach.</I><BR><BR>'Tis good to see you. I see that you have not yet collected all of the images we need. 'Tis fine, but I'll be needing those before I can make the toy figurines. Return when you have the complete set of images.<BR><BR>
1055130	<I>Elwood suddenly stops and beckons you over to him.</I><BR><BR>Over here. Come here. Don't be alarmed, but I think one of the tavernkeepers used to be a wandering healer. Said something about the good ole days when people would just walk up and hand gold to them. Piles of gold. Out of the blue. Can you imagine? Got so much gold, this ex-healer decided to buy a tavern and settle down. Kind of sad really. Can't even cure my hangover now. Nice tavern though.<BR><BR>Right. Anyway. Let me know when those toy figurines are ready. I'll be here. As always.
1055131	<I>Tomas grins as you walk toward him.</I><BR><BR>I see that you have collected all of the images we need. 'Tis good. I'll begin straight away on the toy figurines. I'll have them delivered to you when ready. Where shall I send them? To Elwood in Haven? Yes, I know him. We've done business in the past. Odd fellow.<BR><BR>Tomas smiles as you return his enchanted paints back to him.<BR><BR>
1055132	Return to Elwood with news that the toy figurines will be delivered when ready.
1055133	<I>Elwood is singing as you greet him.</I><BR><BR>Come. Join in. It's a Gabriel Piete song. I have the sheet music for it. It's even autographed by Gabriel Piete himself. Yes. One of his songs. Brilliant.<BR><BR>So let me see the toys. Figurines. Let's see them. Oh. You don't have them yet. I see. Well. Okay. That's too bad.
1055134	<I>Elwood takes a sip of his ale as you address him.</I><BR><BR>Ah. That's the stuff. Ale. Nothing better. What's that? Toy figurines will be delivered. Right. Yes. Perhaps better than Ale. Tough one.<BR><BR>Very good work. Quite. Think we're all done now. You completed everything I asked. Would work with you again. Yes. We should.<BR><BR>Ah. Yes. your payment. The usual. I think you'll be pleased.<BR><BR><I>With that Elwood rummages around in his backpack. He eventually pulls out a small bag and hands it to you.</I>
1055135	<I>Elwood stares at you as you approach.</I><BR><BR>I know you. Oh yes. You've been running some errands for me. We are about done. Noticed that your backpack is a bit full. Might want to make some room. Won't be able to hold your payment. Come back when you have more room, and we'll conclude our business.
1055136	Return to Elwood for your reward when you have some room in your backpack.

1060005	You are attempting to replace your current house.  Your house will vanish and the land it occupies will be outlined in red.  For 10 minutes, only you will be allowed to place a house over the red-outlined land.  You can use any house placement tool to place any house type in a new location near to or directly on the reserved land.  If you successfully place a new house, the land reservation markings will disappear and others may attempt to place houses in that area.  If you fail to place a new house in 10 minutes, die, log out, or move more than 30 tiles from the center of the reserved land, your original house will reappear at its previous location.  All of your locked down and secure items will be preserved in a House Moving Crate while you do this.  Are you sure you wish to continue?
1060006	Make This House Customizable
1060007	More than ten minutes have passed since you initiated House Replacement.  Since you have not yet placed your original house in a new location or placed a new house, your original house has been restored to its original location.
1060008	You have moved more than 30 tiles away from the center of your original house, or you have crossed subserver boundaries.  Since you have not yet placed your original house in a new location or placed a new house, your original house has been restored to its original location.
1060009	You have died, lost connection, or logged out.  Since you have not yet placed your original house in a new location or placed a new house, your original house has been restored to its original location.
1060010	You have successfully relocated your original house.  All of its contents have been moved with the house.
1060011	<unused>
1060012	You have successfully replaced your original house with a new house.  The value of the replaced house has been deposited into your bank box.  All of the items in your original house have been relocated to a Moving Crate in the new house.  Any deed-based house add-ons have been converted back into deeds.  Vendors and barkeeps in the house, if any, have been stored in the Moving Crate as well.  Use the <B>Get Vendor</B> context-sensitive menu option on your character to retrieve them.  These containers can be used to re-create the vendor in a new location.  Any barkeepers have been converted into deeds.
1060013	You are about to turn your house into a customizable house.  You will be refunded the value of this house, and then be charged the cost of the equivalent customizable dirt lot.  All of your possessions in the house will be transported to a Moving Crate.  Deed-based house add-ons will be converted back into deeds.  Vendors and barkeeps will also be stored in the Moving Crate.  Your house will be leveled to its foundation, and you will be able to build new walls, windows, doors, and stairs.  Are you sure you wish to continue?
1060014	Only the dead may pass.
1060015	Grudgingly pay the money
1060016	I'd rather stay dead, you scoundrel!!!
1060017	Wishing to rejoin the living, are you?  I can restore your body... for a price of course...
1060018	Do you accept the fee, which will be withdrawn from your bank?
1060019	You decide against paying the healer, and thus remain dead.
1060020	Unfortunately, you do not have enough cash in your bank to cover the cost of the healing.
1060021	~1_AMOUNT~ gold has been withdrawn from your bank to cover the price of the healing.
1060022	You have ~1_AMOUNT~ gold in cash remaining in your bank box.

1060094	<I>An old man who looks to be 200 years old from the looks of his translucently pale and heavily wrinkled skin, turns to you and gives you a half-cocked grin that makes you feel somewhat uneasy.<BR><BR> After a short pause, he begins to speak to you...</I><BR><BR>Hmm. What's this?  Another budding Necromancer to join the ranks of Evil?  Here... let me take a look at you...  Ah yes...  Very Good! I sense the forces of evil are strong within you, child – but you need training so that you can learn to focus your skills against those aligned against our cause.  You are destined to become a legendary Necromancer - with the proper training, that only I can give you.<BR><BR><I>Mardoth pauses just long enough to give you a wide, skin-crawling grin.</I><BR><BR>Let me introduce myself.  I am Mardoth, the guildmaster of the Necromantic Brotherhood.  I have taken it upon myself to train anyone willing to learn the dark arts of Necromancy.  The path of destruction, decay and obliteration is not an easy one.  Only the most evil and the most dedicated can hope to master the sinister art of death.<BR><BR>I can lend you training and help supply you with equipment – in exchange for a few services rendered by you, of course.  Nothing major, just a little death and destruction here and there - the tasks should be easy as a tasty meat pie for one as treacherous and evil as yourself.<BR><BR>What do you say?  Do we have a deal?
1060095	Dark Tides
1060096	
1060097	
1060098	
1060099	Excellent choice, young apprentice of evil!<BR><BR>I will not waste our time with pleasantries.  There is much work to be done – especially in light of the recent Paladin ambushes that we have suffered.  The necromantic brotherhood is working towards the summoning of the elder daemon Kronus, who will rise from the Well of Tears to help us finally crush the Paladin forces that have plagued our lands for so long now.<BR><BR>To summon Kronus, we must energize the Well of Tears with a series of dark rituals.  Unfortunately the rituals needed to sufficiently energize the Well of Tears have been lost to us.  Your task will be to recover one of the ritual scrolls needed for the summoning.<BR><BR>You will need to find the corpse of the Arch Necromancer Maabus, which has been laid to rest in the tomb of elders.  We believe his spirit may have memory of where we may find the scrolls needed for the summoning.  You will need to awaken him from the slumber of death, using your Animate Dead spell, of course.<BR><BR>To reach the tomb, step onto the magical teleporter just to the <a href = "?ForceTopic13">West</a> of where I am standing.<BR><BR>Once you have been teleported, follow the path, which will lead you to the tomb of Maabus.<BR><BR>One more thing before you go:<BR><BR>Should you get into trouble out there or should you lose your way, do not worry. I have also given you a magical horn - a <I>Horn of Retreat</I>. Play the horn at any time to open a magical gateway that leads back to this tower.<BR><BR>Should your horn run out of <a href = "?ForceTopic83">charges</a>, simply hand me the horn to have it recharged.<BR><BR>Good luck friend.
1060100	...
1060101	...
1060102	Re-animate the corpse of Maabus using your <a href="?ForceTopic112">Animate Dead</a> spell and question him about the Kronus rituals.
1060103	<I>Maabus emits an ear-crawling screech as his body reanimates.  He turns and angrily screams at you</I>:<BR><BR>YOU INFIDEL!  HOW DARE YOU AWAKEN MAABUS!?!<BR><BR><I>Maabus continues to scream at you angrily for some time.  As he settles down, you explain to him the purpose of your visit.  Once you explain that you are on a quest to summon the elder daemon Kronus, Maabus begins to cooperate, and begins to speak in a more reasonable tone</I>:<BR><BR>Well, why didn’t you say so?  If you’re going to raise Kronus from the Well of Tears, you must first complete a long series of dark rituals.  I once owned one of the scrolls needed for the summoning, but alas it was lost to me when I lost my life to a cowardly Paladin ambush near the Paladin city of Light.  They would have probably hidden the scroll in their precious crystal cave near the city.<BR><BR>There is a teleporter in the corner of this tomb.  It will transport you near the crystal cave at which I believe one of the calling scrolls is hidden.  Good luck.<BR><BR><I>Maabus' body slumps back into the coffin as your magic expires</I>.
1060104	Take the teleporter in the corner of Maabus' tomb to the crystal cave where the calling scroll is kept.
1060105	<I>An old man, dressed in slightly tattered armor, whom you recognize to be a Paladin stands before the Crystal Cave staring blankly into the space in front of him.  As he begins to speak to you, you realize this man is blind.  You attempt to persuade the blind man that you are a Paladin seeking to inspect the scroll of calling...</I><BR><BR>Greetings traveler!<BR><BR>You seek entrance to the Crystal Cave, home of the Calling Scroll?  Hmm.  You reak of death and decay, brother.  You reak of death like a Necromancer, but yet you claim to be a Paladin in hopes that I will grant thee passage into the cave?<BR><BR>Please don’t think ill of me for this, but I’m just a blind, old man looking to keep the brotherhood of Paladins safe from the clutches of the elder daemon Kronus.  The Necromancers have been after this particular scroll for quite some time, so we must take all the security precautions we can.<BR><BR>Before I can let you pass into the Crystal Cave, you must speak to me the secret word that is kept in the Scroll of Abraxus in the Vault of Secrets at the Paladin city of Light.  It’s the only way that I can be sure you are who you claim to be, since Necromancers cannot enter the Vault due to powerful protective magic that the brotherhood has blessed the vault with.
1060106	Infiltrate the city of the Paladins and figure out a way into the Vault. See Mardoth for help with this objective.
1060107	<I>Mardoth looks at you expectantly until you tell him that you failed to retrieve the scroll...</I><BR><BR>You failed?  Very unfortunate...  So now you must find your way into the paladin’s Vault of Secrets, eh?  Well, you won't be able to get in – there is a powerful magic aura that protects the Vault from all Necromancers.  We simply cannot enter.  However, that's not to say your familiar spirit can't.<BR><BR><I>Mardoth grins with obvious satisfaction as he explains the details of the <a href="?ForceTopic127">Summon Familiar</a> spell to you...</I>, which will allow you to summon a scavenging Horde Minion to steal the scroll.<BR><BR>Very well.  You are prepared to go.  Take the teleporter just to the <a href = "?ForceTopic13">West</a> of where I am standing to transport to the Paladin city of Light.  Once you have arrived in the city, follow the road of glowing runes to the Vault of Secrets.  You know what to do.
1060108	Use the teleporter near Mardoth to be transported to the Paladin City of Light.
1060109	Follow the road paved with glowing runes to find the Vault of Secrets.  Be careful not to give yourself away as a Necromancer while in the city.
1060110	You have arrived in the Vault of Secrets.  You can feel the protective magic in this place restricting you, making you feel nearly claustrophobic.<BR><BR>Just ahead of you and out of your reach, you see a collection of scrolls and books, one of them being entitled 'Scroll of Abraxus' .  You can only assume that this scroll holds the current password required to enter the Crystal Cave.<BR><BR>This would be a good opportunity to <a href="?ForceTopic127">summon your familiar</a>.  Since your familiar is not a Necromancer, it will not be affected by the anti-magic aura that surrounds the Vault.<BR><BR>Summon your familiar with the <a href="?ForceTopic127">Summon Familiar</a> spell.
1060111	You instinctively will your familiar to fetch the book for you.
1060112	This would be a good opportunity to summon your familiar.  Since your familiar is not a Necromancer, it will not be affected by the anti-magic aura that surrounds this Vault.<BR><BR><a href="?ForceTopic127">Summon your familiar</a> and will it to fetch the book for you.
1060113	You instinctively will your familiar to fetch the scroll for you.
1060114	You have obtained the Scroll of Abraxus, which contains the secret password needed to gain passage into the Crystal Cave where the Scroll of Calling is kept.  Read the scroll (double click) and figure out the password.<BR><BR>Once you have the password, return to the Crystal Cave and speak the password to the guard.<BR><BR>If you do not know the way to the Crystal Cave from the Paladin City, you can use the magic teleporter located just outside of the vault.
1060115	Now that you have the password, return to the Crystal Cave to speak with the guard there.  Use the teleporter outside of the vault to get there if necessary.
1060116	Security at the Crystal Cave<BR><BR>We have taken great measures to ensure the safety of the Scroll of Calling, which we have so valiantly taken from the Necromancer Maabus during the battle of the wood nearly 200 years ago.<BR><BR>The scroll must never fall into the hands of the Necromancers again, lest they use it to summon the ancient daemon Kronus.  The scroll of calling is a necessity in the series of dark rites the Necromancers must perform to once again re-awaken Kronus.<BR><BR>Should Kronus ever rise again, the days of the Paladins, and indeed humanity as we know it will be numbered.<BR><BR>For this reason, we have posted the honorable Horus, former General of the Northern Legions to guard the entrance of the Crystal Cave where we keep the Scroll of Calling.  Horus was infused with magical life from the tree Urywen during his last battle.  The power gave him eternal life, but it also, unfortunately, took his eye sight.<BR><BR>Since Horus cannot see those he admits to the Crystal Cave, he will only allow those that know the secret password to enter.  Speak the following word to Horus and he shall grant you passage to the Crystal Cave:<BR><BR><I>Urywen</I><BR><BR>Do not speak this password anywhere except when seeking passage into the Crystal Cave, as our adversaries are lurking in the shadows – they are everywhere.<BR><BR>Go with the light, friend.<BR><BR><I>- Frater Melkeer</I>
1060117	Speak the secret word that you read in the scroll stolen from the Vault to Horus the guard, using his <a href="?ForceTopic90">context menu</a>.
1060118	Very well Paladin, you have proven to me your identity.  I grant thee passage.<BR><BR>Be careful, however – I’ve heard that the cave has been infested with a vermin of some sort.  Our High Lord Melkeer was supposed to send some troops to clear the vermin out of the cave, but that was last week already.  I fear that he forgot.<BR><BR>If you can find it in your goodness to dispose of at least 5 of those vermin in there, I shall reward your efforts.  If however you are too busy, and I would understand if you were, don’t bother with the vermin.<BR><BR>You may now pass through the energy barrier to enter the Crystal Cave.   Take care honorable Paladin soul.  Walk in the light my friend.
1060119	Enter the Crystal Cave and find the Scroll of Calling.  The barrier will now allow you to pass.
1060120	You rummage through the scrolls until you find the Scroll of Calling.  You quickly put it in your pack.
1060121	You have returned with the scroll!  I knew I could count on you.  You can now perform the rite of calling at the Well of Tears.  This ritual will help charge the Well to prepare for the coming of Kronus.   You are prepared to do your part young Necromancer!<BR><BR>Just outside of this tower, you will find a path lined with red lanterns.  Follow this path to get to the Well of Tears.  Once you have arrived at the Well, use the scroll to perform the ritual of calling.  Performing the rite will empower the well and bring us that much closer to the arrival of Kronus.<BR><BR>Once you have completed the ritual, return here for your promised reward.
1060122	STOP WICKED ONE!
1060123	I will slay you before I allow you to complete your evil rites!
1060124	Step onto the teleporter near Mardoth and follow the path of glowing runes to the tomb of Maabus.
1060125	Find the Crystal Cave password by reading (double click) the golden scroll entitled "Scroll of Abraxus" that you got from your familiar..
1060126	You have disposed of the creatures as Horus has asked. See him on your way out of the Crystal Cave to claim your reward.
1060127	You have obtained the scroll of calling. See Mardoth for further instructions.
1060128	Follow the red lanterns to the Well of Tears where you will perform the calling of Kronus.
1060129	You have arrived at the well, but no longer have the scroll of calling.  Use Mardoth's teleporter to return to the Crystal Cave and fetch another scroll from the box.
1060130	Use the Scroll of Calling (double click) near the Well of Tears to charge the waters for the arrival of Kronus.
1060131	Victory! You have done as Mardoth has asked of you. Take as much of your foe's loot as you can carry and return to Mardoth for your reward.
1060132	Although you were slain by the cowardly paladin, you managed to complete the rite of calling as instructed. Return to Mardoth.
1060133	You have done as I asked... I knew I could count on you from the moment you walked in here!<BR><BR>The forces of evil are strong within you.  You will become a great Necromancer in this life - perhaps even the greatest.<BR><BR>My work for you is done here.  I release you from my service to go into the world and fight for our cause...<BR><BR>Oh...I almost forgot - your reward.  Here is a magical weapon and 2000 gold for you, in the form of a check.  Don't spend it all in one place though, eh?<BR><BR>Actually, before you can spend any of it at all, you will have to <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash the check</a> at the nearest bank.  Shopkeepers never accept checks for payment, they require cash.<BR><BR>In your pack, you will find an enchanted sextant.  Use this sextant to guide you to the nearest bank.<BR><BR>Farewell, and stay true to the ways of the shadow...
1060134	Use the enchanted sextant in your pack to locate the nearest bank.  Go there and speak with the Banker.
1060135	My new string
1060136	Locate the nearest Bank using the enchanted sextant in your pack.  Once there, <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash your check</a>.
1060137	<I>The banker smiles at you and greets you in a loud and robust voice...</I><BR><BR>Well hello there adventurer! I see you've learned how to cash checks. Wonderful! Let me tell you a bit about the banks in this world...<BR><BR>Anything that you place into any bank box, can be retrieved from any other bank box in the land. For instance, if you place an item into a bank box in Britain, it can be retrieved from your bank box in Moonglow or any other city.<BR><BR> Bank boxes are very secure. So secure, in fact, that no one can ever get into your bank box except for yourself. Security is hard to come by these days, but you can trust in the banking system of Britannia! We shall not let you down! <BR><BR>I hope to be seeing much more of you as your riches grow! May your bank box overflow with the spoils of your adventures.<BR><BR>Farewell adventurer, you are now free to explore the world on your own.
1060138	<I>In case you change your mind later...</I><BR><BR>You may re-start this quest at any time, simply by returning to Mardoth's home and speaking with him using his context menu.<BR><BR>
1060139	You have made my work easy for me, ~1_NAME~.  My task here is done.

I know we have just met, but time is short and we need to reinforce the troops in the mountain pass, so I will not waste your time with pleasantries.<BR><BR>We have been trying to fight back the wicked <I>Horde Minions</I> which have recently begun attacking our cities - but to no avail.  We desperately need help!<BR><BR>Your first task will be to assess the situation in the mountain pass, and help our troops defeat the Horde Minions there.<BR><BR>Before I send you into battle however, it is time that I teach you a thing or two about the way of the Paladin.<BR><BR><U>The Paladin</U><BR><BR>Paladins are the holy warriors of the realm who have dedicated themselves as protectors of the virtues and vanquishers of all that is evil.<BR><BR>Paladins have several <a href = "?ForceTopic111">special abilities</a> that are not available to the ordinary warrior. Due to the spiritual nature of these abilities, the Paladin requires some amount of mana to activate them. In addition to mana, the Paladin is also required to spend a certain amount of <a href = "?ForceTopic109">tithing points</a> each time a special ability is used.<BR><BR>Tithing points and mana are automatically consumed when a special Paladin ability is activated. All Paladin abilities are activated through the <a href = "?ForceTopic114">Book of Chivalry</a><BR><BR>Go now, to the shrine just East of here, just before the doors and <a href = "?ForceTopic109">tithe</a> at least 500 gold.<BR><BR>Return here when you are done.

1060211	<I>Cleanse by Fire</I> is the basic Cure ability for the Paladin.  The Paladin uses the Cleanse by Fire ability to neutralize any poisons from a target.  When he does this, he takes an amount of fire damage based on a combination of his Karma and Chivalry levels.  The lower the Paladin's Karma, the higher the fire damage.  The higher the Paladin's Chivalry skill is, the lower the amount of fire damage taken.
1060212	<I>Close Wounds</I> is the basic healing ability for a Paladin.  Using this ability, allows the Paladin to target another player or creature for divine healing.  The amount of Hit Points healed depends on the Paladin’s level of Karma and their skill in Chivalry.  A lower level of Karma lowers the amount of healing but a higher skill level in Chivalry will raise the amount.
1060213	The <I>Consecrate Weapon</I> ability allows the Paladin to temporarily imbue the weapon he is holding with holy magic.<BR><BR> The result is a weapon that deals damage of a type equal to the target’s worst resistance.  In other words,  if a consecrated weapon attacks a Fire Elemental, whose worst resistance is to cold, each hit with the Consecrated Weapon will deal cold damage to that fire elemental.<BR><BR>The duration of the effect is based off of the Paladin's level of Karma and Chivalry skill.  Lower Karma will shorten the effect, but higher Chivalry skill will lengthen the effect.
1060214	The <I>Dispel Evil</I> Paladin ability affects a small area around the Paladin.  Any evil creatures that come into the affected area may be destroyed or repelled, causing them to flee from combat.  This ability targets evil summoned creatures as well as non-summoned evil creatures.<BR><BR><I>Dispel Evil</I> can also target player Necromancers that are under effect of the <I>Wraith Form</I> spell.   The ability will cause transformed Necromancers to suffer some amount of Mana and Stamina loss.<BR><BR>The chance for successful use of this ability is modified by the Paladin's level of Karma and Chivalry skill.  While lower Karma will decrease the effectiveness of this ability, higher skill in Chivalry will increase it's effectiveness.
1060215	The Paladin’s <I>Divine Fury</I> ability allows him to wage a raging battle against the forces of evil, causing him to swing faster, hit better, and do more damage.  While under the effect of this Holy Fury, the Paladin's ability to defend himself is severely lowered.<BR><BR>In order to commit himself to the proper state of mind for this ability, the Paladin must be at full mana.
1060216	Your shot was successful
1060217	The <I>Enemy of One</I> Paladin ability causes the <I>next</I> creature the Paladin strikes to become his “mortal enemy”.  For the duration of the effect, whenever the Paladin strikes a creature that is his sworn “mortal enemy”, his damage is greatly increased.<BR><BR>Because the Paladin is so completely focused on a specific enemy type, however, all other creature types will have their damage against the Paladin increased when they strike him.
1060218	The Paladin’s <I>Holy Light</I> ability is the only direct-damage ability that the Paladin possesses.  Calling on the powers of his faith, he may call forth a magnificent beacon of holy light which damages all enemies in a small radius around the caster.
1060219	The Paladin’s <I>Noble Sacrifice</I> ability allows him to sacrifice himself for the greater good of those in the area.  When the ability is used, the Paladin is taken down to one (1) Hit Point, one (1) Stamina, and one (1) Mana.<BR><BR>In response to the Paladin's sacrifice, all of the dead in the affected area are offered resurrection, while all of the living are Cured and Healed.
1060220	The Paladin’s <I>Remove Curse</I> ability allows him to remove all <I>Curse</I> type effects from a single target.  Curses include all Necromancer curses, as well as the spells Feeblemind, Clumsy, Weaken, and Paralyze.
1060221	The Paladin ability <I>Sacred Journey</I> mimics the mage spell of <I>Recall</I> almost exactly, in that it allows a Paladin to instantly travel to any location for which he has a marked recall rune.<BR><BR>The Paladin cannot take a <I>Sacred Journey</I> if he is targeting or is being targeted by any creature, or is in combat. 
1060222	Tithing points are gained by tithing gold to the Virtue Shrines.  A Paladin who tithes gold to the shrine is making manifest his devotion to the concepts and beliefs that the Shrines exemplify.<BR><BR>Once gained through an act of tithing, these 'points' may be used by the Paladin to summon the divine abilities granted to his class.<BR><BR>Each use of a Paladin Ability consumes Tithing Points in addition to the pure energy of Mana.
1060223	Players may tithe gold to the Virtue Shrines by opening the context sensitive menu interface on the shrine's Ankh.  There they may choose the <a href="?ForceTopic109">Tithe Gold</a> option, which will bring up the Tithing Interface.  The Tithing Interface lists the amount of gold the player is currently holding.  The player may then use the four arrows to convert Gold into Tithing points and vice versa.<BR><BR>When the <I>OK</I> button is clicked, the player's tithed Gold will be converted into the listed amount of Tithing Points.
1060224	The Paladin has many special abilities he can call forth through the use of his <I>Book of Chivalry</I>.<BR><BR>The Book Of Chivalry can be thought of as the Paladin's spell book.  To use an ability, simply open the Book of Chivalry to the appropriate page and double click the icon of the ability you wish to activate<BR><BR>The following abilities are available to the Paladin at various points of his development:<BR><BR>* Cleanse by Fire<BR>* Close Wounds<BR>* Consecreate Weapon<BR>* Dispel Evil<BR>* Divine Fury<BR>* Enemy of One<BR>* Holy Light<BR>* Noble Sacrifice<BR>* Remove Curse<BR>* Sacred Journey

1062116	This topic covers the basics of housing in UO, from placement to trading to customization.  Please see Related Topics above for more information.
1062117	HOUSE PLACEMENT
1062118	You can create a house by using a <B>house placement tool</B>.  This device can be purchased from an Architect NPC in many towns across the land.  The tool itself is inexpensive, but in order to place a house you will need to have sufficient funds in your bank box to pay for it.  In addition to the tool and funds, you must also have an open spot of land outside of town that is level and free of obstructions.  If you have found such a spot, then double-click your House Placement Tool and choose the type of house to place from the menu.  Next, you will see a ghosted image of the selected house on your targeting cursor.  Position the ghosted house and click to try to place it.  If placement fails, you will be notified as to the reason, and you can try again.  There are several important rules about house placement, which are detailed in the paragraphs following: <a href = "?136">Location</a>, <a href = "?137">Terrain</a>, <a href = "?138">Other Houses</a>, <a href = "?139">Ownership Restrictions</a>.
1062119	LOCATIONS
1062120	<B>Locations:</B>  <a href = "?135" >House placement</a> is not allowed within the boundaries of any town or other region protected by guards.  Housing is also not allowed near any dungeon entrance or shrine.  The area known as the Lost Lands, and the entire facet of Ilshenar are also not suitable for housing.  Finally, some areas have been reserved for other reasons.  When you try to place in these illegal locations, you will be informed that housing is not allowed there.
1062121	TERRAIN
1062122	<B>Terrain:</B>  Houses can only be <a href = "?135">built</a> on level terrain that is free of obstruction.  The entire plot of land that your new house will rest on must all be completely flat.  Furthermore, the house's foundation and front steps cannot rest on any obstruction, or be adjacent to any obstruction.  An obstruction is considered to be a part of the landscape that a player cannot walk over.  Obstructions may exist <B>under</B> the house, so long as they are not tall enough to poke up through the floor of the house.  It must be possible to walk all the way around the house staying adjacent to its walls or front steps, without being blocked by anything on the terrain.
1062123	OTHER HOUSES
1062124	<B>Other Houses:</B>  When <a href = "?135">placing a new house</a>, remember that no two houses can be adjacent in the east/west direction -- there must be an unobstructed path at least one tile wide between any two houses.  Also, there is a five-tile buffer zone to the north and south of a house that must remain clear of all other houses.  Finally, you cannot place a house whose corner is adjacent diagonally to the corner of another house.
1062125	OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS
1062126	<B>Ownership Restrictions:  </B>You may only <a href = "?135">place</a> or be <a href = "?140">traded</a> a house once every 7 days.  You may only own one house on your account.  If you place or receive a second house, any other house(s) on your account, across all shards, will become <a href = "?97">condemned</a>.
1062127	HOUSE TRADING
1062128	You can buy a house from another player or sell a house to another player, using the standard Trade Window.  It is not possible to exchange houses this way.  In order to have a house traded to you, you must meet all house <a href = "?139">ownership restrictions</a>.  If you do, then it is possible for the house owner to open a trade window containing a house trade scroll.  For this to happen, both you and the house owner must be outside the house and standing within two paces of the house sign.  You both must remain within 2 tiles of the house sign or the trade will fail.  The trade scroll shows the name of the house owner, the name of the house, and the sextant coordinates of the house.  This scroll is also a distinctive ice-blue color that cannot be faked.  <B>Be sure to verify you are buying the correct house!</B>  Once both parties double-check the trade and agree to it, the house is transferred.
1062129	HOUSE CONVERSION
1062130	If you have a static non-customizable house, it may be possible to convert it into a <a href = "?144">dirt lot</a>.  The following house types <B>cannot</B> be converted:  Castles, Keeps, Two-Story Wood and Plaster, and Two-Story Stone and Plaster.  All other house types can be converted.  When you convert a house into a dirt lot, the house vanishes and is replaced with a dirt lot exactly the same size as the original house.  This conversion is completely secure and automatic, so there is no risk of losing your house.  If you meet the <a href = "?139">restrictions</a> for owning a customizable dirt lot, you may perform the conversion using your house sign menu.<BR><BR>When you convert the house, you are refunded the original purchase price of the house, then charged the cost of the equivalent dirt lot.  In most cases, the original cost of a house is more than the cost of a dirt lot with the same footprint, meaning you will get a refund (which can be used towards customizing your lot).  Note that "original purchase price" refers to the cost of the deed used to place the house, or the cost listed on the House Placement Tool menu for the house, and <B>not</B> the amount the house was traded for in its last player-to-player trade.
1062131	HOUSE RESTRICTIONS
1062132	You are limited to owning one house on your account across all shards.  If you own a house on one shard, you cannot own a house on another shard.  If at any time you place a new house or receive a house in trade, your house will become condemned.  A condemned house will decay within 5 days.  The only way to un-condemn a house is to trade it to another player.  If you trade away your new house, this will <B>not</B> un-condemn your other house.<BR><BR>Whenever you place a house or receive on in trade with another player, you may not place another house or receive another house in trade for seven days, even if you demolish the house or trade it to another player.<BR><BR>In order to own a <a href = "?143?">customizable</a> house, your account must be upgraded to <I>Ultima Online:  Age of Shadows</I>.  If your account is not upgraded, you cannot place a customizable <a href = "?144?">dirt lot</a>, nor can you receive a customizable house in trade.
1062133	HOUSE CUSTOMIZATION
1062134	Customizable houses have two modes: <a href = "?168">normal</a> and <a href = "?169">customization</a>.<BR><BR>When you enter Customization Mode, all of the house's contents are either ejected or packed into a <a href = "?170">Moving Crate</a>.  As you customize your house, no objects, players, or monsters can interact with you or the house.  You can leave customization mode by <a href = "?165">committing a new design</a>, or by <a href = "?164">saving your design for later</a>.  Committing a new design costs you money and requires you to manuall unpack the moving crate.  Saving a design for later restores the house to its former state.<BR><BR>Custom houses must obey certain <a href = "?163">structural support</a> rules.<BR><BR>While customizing a house, a special house building interface appears on your screen.  This interface has a multitude of options, listed here:<BR><BR><a href = "?157">Component Selection</a> (<a href = "?173">Walls</a>, <a href = "?158">Floors</a>, <a href = "?159">Doors</a>, <a href = "?160">Stairs</a>, <a href = "?161">Teleporters</a>, and <a href = "?162">Miscellaneous</a>);  <a href = "?155">Eraser</a>; <a href = "?154">Eyedropper</a>; <a href = "?147">System Menu</a> (<a href = "?148">Synch</a>, <a href = "?149">Clear</a>, <a href = "?150">Backup</a>, <a href = "?151">Restore</a>, <a href = "?152">Commit</a>, <a href = "?153">Revert</a>); <a href = "?156">component and fixture counter</a>; <a href = "?146">component menu</a>; <a href = "?174">transparency selection</a> buttons; <a href = "?175">story selection</a> buttons; and <a href = "?167">cost</a> counter.
1062135	COMPONENT MENU
1062136	The center area of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> is where you select components to paint onto your house design.  Most <a href = "?157">categories</a> of components have multiple pages of items to choose from.  The arrow icons on the left and right edges of this menu allow you to switch between pages of available components.  From this menu, click a component, and you will enter paint mode with the selected component active.<BR><BR>When entering the <a href = "?173">walls</a> or <a href = "?162">miscellaneous</a> categories, this area first shows a one-page list of subcategories.  Click a subcategory to browse the individual sets of components in that category.  When browsing a subcategory, an upward pointing arrow icon here allows you to return to the category list.<BR><BR>When in the walls category, this menu has an extra button that toggles windows on and off.  If you wish to place walls with built-in windows, click the window toggle.<BR><BR>In the <a href = "?159">doors</a> category, icons next to each door show which way the door opens.
1062137	SYSTEM MENU
1062138	The system menu button in the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> shows several icons that allow you to change house modes and access additional features.  The buttons are:<BR><BR><a href = "?148">Synch</a>, <a href = "?149">Clear</a>, <a href = "?150">Backup</a>, <a href = "?151">Restore</a>, <a href = "?152">Commit</a>, <a href = "?153">Revert</a>.
1062139	SYNCH
1062140	While <a href = "?145">customizing</a> your house, network conditions may cause your client to lose synchronization with the server.  Use this <a href = "?147">system menu</a> button to force a re-synchronization.  This completely resets your client's view of your house design to match the one on the server.
1062141	CLEAR
1062142	While <a href = "?145">customizing</a> your house, you may wish to simply erase your current design and start over.  Click the Clear button on the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> to erase your current design and start over with an empty dirt lot.  Note that this only clears your current in-progress design, and does not erase your active design or your <a href = "?150">saved</a> design.
1062143	BACKUP
1062144	Click the Backup button in the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> to create a backup of your in-progress design.  Whenever you leave design mode without committing your new design, your in-progress design is automatically backedup.  Your house can only have one backed up design, so using this option overwrites your previous backup.  Use the <a href = "?151">restore</a> button to load your backed up design into your in-progress design.
1062145	RESTORE
1062146	Click the Restore button in the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> to restore a previously <a href = "?150">backed up,</a> house design.  This does not affect your house's active design.
1062147	COMMIT
1062148	The Commit button is located in the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a>.  Click this button to finalize your in-progress design and make it your house's active design.  See <a href = "?165">committing a new house design</a> for more information.
1062149	REVERT
1062150	While <a href = "?145">customizing</a> your house, you may wish to replace your in-progress house design</a> with your current active design.  This is much like <a href = "?151">restoring</a> a design, except you are loading the last design you <a href = "?152">committed</a> rather than the last design you <a href = "?150">backed up</a>.
1062151	EYEDROPPER
1062152	The eyedropper tool in the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> allows you to instantly select a <a href = "?146">component</a> already in your house design.  Click the Eraser icon, and target the component to copy.  The component menu switches to the page where the selected component can be found, and your cursor switches to painting mode with that component active.
1062153	ERASER
1062154	The eraser tool in the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> allows you to delete <a href = "?146">components</a> from your house design.  To erase components from your house design, click the Erase icon and target tiles to delete.  The tile to be deleted highlights red when your cursor is over it.  Click to erase the tile.  You cannot click and drag to delete multiple components.  You must single-click once for each tile to be deleted.
1062155	COMPONENT AND FIXTURE COUNTER
1062156	These numbers near the bottom of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> display the number of components and number of fixtures in your house design.  Hovering your mouse over this counter brings up a small window showing more details.<BR><BR>Each fixture also counts as a component.  Fixtures are components that are interactive, and currently include <a href = "?159">doors</a> and <a href = "?161">teleporters</a>.  Fixtures also count towards your house secure storage limit.  The number of fixtures allowed in a house design is limited.
1062157	COMPONENT SELECTION
1062158	On the left side of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu are nine buttons organized in three rows of three.  The first two rows open lists of components you can paint onto your house design.  To choose a component to paint, click the desired category and then select a component from the <a href = "?146">component menu.<B><B>The available categories of components are: <a href = "?173">Walls, <a href = "?158">Floors</a>, <a href = "?159">Doors</a>, <a href = "?160">Stairs</a>, <a href = "?161">Teleporters</a>, and <a href = "?162">Miscellaneous</a>.
1062159	WALLS
1062160	<a href = "?146">Components</a> are categorized in the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> by style.  They are organized according to how they should be positioned in your house.  Use the V-shaped corner piece when two walls should to the south and east.  The smallest pieces here are the corner posts that join walls to the north and west.  The remaining wall pieces are north and east facing walls.  With a little practice, you'll get a good feel for how these pieces connect together.  Walls must be <a href = "?163">structurally supported</a> and if they are full-height they can provide support for floor components above them.<BR><BR>You may use the window toggle at the top of the component menu to select walls with built-in windows to place in your house design.
1062161	FLOORS
1062162	Floor <a href = "?146">components</a> are categorized in the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> by style.  Select the floor you wish to paint onto your house design.  If you wish to change floors that are hidden by walls, use the <a href = "?174">transparency buttons</a> to see behind them.  Floors provide <a href = "?163">structural support</a> for non-floor components positioned on top of them.
1062163	DOORS
1062164	Door <a href = "?146">components</a> are one type of <a href = "?156">fixture</a> you can add to your house.  Simply choose the style of door from the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> you wish to paint on your house design.  Like <a href = "?173">walls</a>, doors require<a href = "?163"> structural support</a>, and can provide support for items above them.
1062165	STAIRS
1062166	Stair <a href = "?146">components</a> come in two types.  First are staircases, which serve to join different stories of your house.  The other type are front steps, which allow access to your foundation.  On the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> for the stairs category, staircases appear on the top row and front step components appear on the bottom row.<BR><BR>Staircases are multiple-tile components that have special properties.  They must have sufficient <a href = "?163">structural support</a>.  Furthermore, you cannot place <a href = "?158">floors</a> in the spaces above a staircase, because those floors would block movement up the staircase.<BR><BR>Front steps can only be placed along the south edge of your house's foundation.  Note that the house customization system will allow you to <a href = "?155">erase</a> all of your front steps.  If you do this, it will be impossible for anyone (including you) to enter your custom house.  Be careful to always create a way to get onto your house!
1062167	TELEPORTERS
1062168	Teleporter <a href = "?146">components</a> are a type of <a href = "?156">fixture</a> you can add to your house.  They are similar in most respects to <a href = "?158">floor</a> components, except that they provide an alternative means to move around in your custom house.<BR><BR>In order for a teleporter to be functional, it must link to one or more other teleporters.  Each teleporter component has a different symbol engraved in it.  To link teleporters, place multiple teleporters of the same symbol.  When you <a href = "?152">commit</a> your design, teleporters with matching symbols link up.<BR><BR>Stepping on one linked teleporter will move your avatar to another teleporter tile with the same symbol.  If there are only two teleporters in your house with the same symbol, stepping on one will always move you to the other.  If three or more teleporters share the same symbol, stepping on one will move you to one of the others with the same symbol, selected randomly.
1062169	MISCELLANEOUS
1062170	The miscellaneous <a href = "?146">component</a> category contains a selection of different tiles, including archways, battlements, columns, fences, and waterfalls.  Like most other components, these require <a href = "?163">structural support</a> and can provide structural support to other components.
1062171	TRANSPARENCY SELECTION
1062172	These controls allow you to change the visibility of walls and floors on different stories of the house, to make it easer to design around them.  Each of the buttons in this column correspond to one story of your house.  Each time you click the button, transparency settings move to the next setting in the cycle.  When you <a href = "?175">change stories</a>, all transparency settings are reset on all storied.
1062173	STORY SELECTION
1062174	To edit a different story of your house, use the buttons in the rightmost column on your house customization interface.  Each button corresponds to one story of your house.  Simply click a button to be transported to that story.  When you do this, <a href = "?174">transparency settings</a> for all stories are reset.
1062175	STRUCTURAL SUPPORT
1062176	Your custom house design must (to a certain degree) obey the laws of physics.  This means that you can't have floors floating on air and hovering columns.  Every <a href = "?146">component</a> in your house must be structurally supported.  Most components provide some form of structural support to other components.<BR><BR>Here is how it works:  There are two main types of structural support:  floors and walls.  Any tile in your house design that does not have valid structural support highlights orange.  You cannot <a href = "?165">commit</a> your house design while any tiles in it are not validly supported.<BR><BR><a href = "?158">Floor (and <a href = "?161">teleporter</a>) tiles must be supported by non-floor components on the story below.  Floor tiles on the first story of your house are considered supported by the foundation below them.  Any <a href = "?173">wall</a>, <a href = "?159">door</a>, or <a href = "?162">miscellaneous</a> component that is the full height of one story of your house can provide structural support for floor components above them.  Any floor tile directly on top of a supporting component is itself considered supported.  Any floor tile adjacent to a directly supported floor tile is also supported.  If you build a solid line of floor tiles between two directly supported tiles, all tiles in that line are validly supported.  Whenever you form a rectangle of supported floor tiles, all floor tiles in that rectangle are validly supported.<BR><BR>Non-floor components must obtain their structural support either from validly supported floors, or from adjacent non-floor items.  Any component that touches the ground can receive its support from a floor tile.  Some components (like parts of archways) do not touch the ground, and can only receive support from an adjacent component that is tall enough.  There is a limit to how far pieces can receive adjacent support.
1062177	SAVING A DESIGN
1062178	If you are not ready to <a href = "?165">commit</a> a new house design, you can save it for later.  To do this, simply right-click the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a>.  You will exit <a href = "?169">customization mode</a> and you can come back and work on your design again later.
1062179	COMMITTING A NEW HOUSE DESIGN
1062180	Once you are completed re-designing your house, you are ready to commit the design.  In order to do so, you must have funds in your bank (in the form of gold and/or checks) to cover the <a href = "?167">cost</a> of your new design.  (Note that if your new design has fewer components in it, you may receive a refund.)  Simply open the <a href = "?147">System Menu</a> in the <a href = "?145">house customization interface</a> and choose the <a href = "?XXX">Commit</a> option.  Once your confirm, your house will change to your new design.  Once you do this, you must check over the security settings on all your <a href = "?159">doors</a> and <a href = "?161">teleporters</a>.
1062181	HOUSE VALUE
1062182	Non-customizable houses have fixed costs.  The cost to place each house type is displayed on the house placement tool menu.  If you demolish a non-customizable house or covert it into a customizable one, you are refunded 90% of this amount (also referred to as the house value).
1062183	CUSTOMIZATION COSTS
1062184	The cost to commit a house design is based on the number of components in the house, including the foundation itself.  The current cost of a house is displayed in the lower-right corner of the house design menu.  When committing a new design, you are refunded 90% of the value of the old design and must pay the cost displayed.
1062185	NORMAL MODE
1062186	In normal mode, customizable houses behave just like any other house -- you can walk around on them or in them, store objects inside, and so forth.  See also:  <a href = "?169">customization mode</a>.
1062187	CUSTOMIZATION MODE
1062188	In Customization Mode, all access to the house is blocked except to the person customizing the house.  In this mode, all other players see the house as it was prior to entering customization mode, but hey cannot enter it or interact with it in any way.  The player actually customizing the house, however, can see and edit a new in-progress design.  When you are customizing a house, you are invisible and safe from attack.  You can walk through the walls of your house and walk on air without falling.  This allows you to change your house design conveniently and in perfect safety.  Note, however, that you cannot do anything else at all in this mode.  While customizing your house, you cannot open your backpack, use any objects, use any skills, speak to other players, or leave the house.  It is much like being a ghost.  See also: <a href = "?168">normal mode</a>.
1062189	MOVING CRATE
1062190	The house moving crate is a special container that holds your locked down items, secure containers, vendors, barkeepers, and house add-ons while you edit your house.  When you enter <a href = "?145">customization mode</a>, your items are packed into the moving crate, which is hidden from view.<BR><BR>If you leave customization mode without committing a new design, your items are automatically unpacked from the moving mrate and restored to their previous position.  The only exception is house add-ons, which remain in deed form inside the moving crate.  You must manually replace these.<BR><BR>When you <a href = "?165">commit</a> a new design, items cannot be automatically unpacked from the moving crate.  You must instead <a href = "?171">unpack</a> these items yourself.
1062191	UNPACKING
1062192	When you <a href = "?165">commit</a> a new house design, items inside your <a href = "?170">moving crate</a> remain inside and hidden.  You must remove these items and position them in your house.  Vendors and barkeeps require <a href = "?172">special handling</a>.<BR><BR>The moving crate cannot be picked up, and you cannot put items inside.  Once you remove an item from the crate, you cannot put it back in.  Items inside the crate count toward your secure storage limit.  Items inside your moving crate are organized into sub-containers.<BR><BR>You can teleport your moving crate to the spot where you are standing at any time by opening your house sign menu, going to the CUSTOMIZATION page, and choosing <B>Relocate Moving Crate</B>.
1062193	UNPACKING VENDORS AND BARKEEPS
1062194	Vendors and barkeepers are invisible when they are inside a <a href = "?170">moving crate</a>.  In order to put them back to work, you must move to the desired location in your house.  Next, open the context-sensitive menu on your avatar and choose the Station Vendor option.  A menu listing all your vendors and barkeeps by name appears.  Select one.  If the place you are standing on is valid, the vendor or barkeep appears there and returns to work.
1062195	personal bless deed for ~1_NAME~
1062196	HOUSE CUSTOMIZATION
1062197	This feature allows you to create a truly unique home by laying out the floor plan and choosing building materials for the walls, floors, and other components.  In order to build or own a custom house, your account must be upgraded to <I>Ultima Online: Age of Shadows</I>.  Not all houses are customizable.  In order to build your own house, you need to obtain a customizable <a href = "?144">dirt lot</a> and sufficient <a href = "?167">funds</a> to pay for the customization.  Using your house sign, you will enter <a href = "?145">customization mode</a> and edit your house's design.  When you are ready, you can <a href = "?165">commit</a> your new design, making it visible for all the world to see.
1062198	DIRT LOTS
1062199	Dirt lots are a special type of house that can be <a href = "?143">customized</a>.  They are in most respects exactly like normal houses, except that only players who have upgraded to Ultima Online: Age of Shadows can own them.  There are three ways to obtain a dirt lot:  by <a href = "?135">placing</a> one, by <a href = "?140">buying</a> one, or by <a href = "?141">converting</a> a house into one.
1062200	A personal bless deed has been placed in your backpack.
1062201	Only the owner, ~1_NAME~, can use this deed.
1062202	This deed allows you to bless an item.  The blessed item cannot be stolen from this character, and will remain with this character when death occurs.  The blessed effects of the item WILL NOT work for any other character, including other characters on your account.
1062203	Blessed for ~1_NAME~
1062204	You personally bless the item for this character.
1062205	Unfortunately you are playing on a *NON-Age-Of-Shadows* game installation and cannot be transported to Malas.  You will not be able to take your new player quest in Malas without an AOS client.  You are now being taken to the city of Haven on the Trammel facet.
1062206	You cannot do that while customizing a house.
1062207	This house is <a href = "?ForceTopic97">Condemned</a>.
1062208	This house is <a href = "?ForceTopic97">Grandfathered</a>.
1062209	This house is <a href = "?ForceTopic97">Automatically</a> refreshed.

(Temporary "followers," such as hirelings, escorts, and animated dead, will not be transferred.)<br>- Please verify the contents of your character's "transfer crate" are correct before initiating the transfer to the new shard. You will not get another opportunity to do so, nor can items be added if you find them missing afterwards.<br>- Houses and their secured items will not be transferred.<br>- You will lose all affiliations to guilds, factions, and parties once the transfer is complete.<br>- Bracelets of Binding and Balls of Pet Summoning will have their links cleared upon transfer to the new shard.<br>- All legacy "house deeds" will be converted into house placement tools.<br>- You can cancel transfer at any point during the process, and resume at a later date.<br>- You will not be able to log into the original or destination shards until the transfer is complete.<br>- You will have to recreate any custom game macros for that character after the transfer to the new shard.<br>- After entering the new shard, <i>you will have 7 days to remove all items from your character's "transfer crate." </i>Any items that remain in the crate after that time will disappear forever.

1062911	Royal Leggings of Embers
1062912	When Britannia was founded, the king was attacked with a fire spell that nearly killed him. (Rumors of his demise were highly exaggerated.) Ever since, he kept a pair of Royal Leggings of Embers nearby.
1062913	Rose of Trinsic
1062914	In the second age of Britannia, the peaceful town of Trinsic was attacked by the forces of chaos. After a fierce, bloody battle, the town was overrun and destroyed. This rose commemorates the Honor of the Trinsic defenders.
1062915	Shamino’s Best Crossbow
1062916	Once a king of Sosaria, Shamino was one of Lord British’s greatest Companions. Hailing from the city of Skara Brae, known for its spiritual people, Shamino followed the life of a ranger and was perhaps the best marksman in the land. This crossbow design is one created especially for him by Iolo, his long-time companion.
1062917	The Tapestry of Sosaria
1062918	The history of the world is recorded in this tapestry, starting with the first days of Britannia to Third Dawn’s age of prosperity and opportunity. It was designed by one of Lord British’s most loyal companions, Iolo, a master bard and storyteller.
1062919	Hearth of the Home Fire
1062920	When Lord Blackthorn waged a dark campaign to steal control of Britannia, the citizens often stayed home at night, not daring to leave their homes. The good people of Britannia spent those cold nights huddled around the warmth of a blazing fireplace like this one.
1062921	The Holy Sword
1062922	The fifth age, known as the Age of Shadows, was a difficult one. Necromancers had learned to raise the dead from their graves, and holy Paladins joined ranks to wipe the dark art of Necromancy from the world. It is a struggle that still continues. Paladins, thanks to a blacksmith with arcane knowledge, now have the Holy Sword to help in their quest.
1062923	Ancient Samurai Helm
1062924	Strange items from a strange land are being found. Rumors abound of a new land with new warriors and new ways to wage war. If the rumors are true, Britannia might never be the same. This strange helm was brought back on a trade vessel. Its exotic beauty pales in the face of its durability.
1062925	Petals:  ~1_COUNT~

1063027	<div align=center>You have challenged this guild to war!</div>
1063028	<I>In case you change your mind later...</I><BR><BR>You may re-start this quest at any time while you are here. Simply return to Daimyo Haochi and speak with him. Once you travel to the city, you will not be able to return. <BR><BR>
1063029	Greetings. I am Daimyo Haochi, the Feudal Lord of this region. <BR><BR>Since you are here at my side, you must wish to learn the ways of the Samurai.<BR><BR> Wielding a blade is easy, anyone can grasp a sword’s hilt. Learning how to fight properly and skillfully is to become an Armsman.<BR><BR> Learning how to master weapons, and even more importantly when not to use them, is the Way of the Warrior. The Way of the Samurai. The Code of the Bushido. That is why you are here. <BR><BR>You will go through 7 trials to prove your adherence to the Samurai code. <BR><BR> The first trial will test your decision making skills. You only have to enter the area beyond the green passageway. <BR><BR>Do not attempt to hurry your trials. The guards will only let you through to each trial when I have deemed you ready.<br><br>As a last resort you may use the golden teleporter tiles in each trial area but do so at your own risk. You may not be able to return and complete your trials once you have chosen to escape.
1063030	Follow the green path. The guards will now let you through.
1063031	Beyond you are two troubled groups.<BR><BR> The Cursed Souls were once proud warriors that were ensorcelled by an evil mage. The mage trapped and killed them later but the spell has not lifted from their souls in death. <BR><BR>The Young Ronin were former Samurai in training who lost their way. They are loyal only to those with enough coin in their pocket. <BR><BR>You must decide who needs to be fought to the death. You may wish to <a href="?ForceTopic27">review combat techniques</a> as well as <a href = "?ForceTopic29">information on healing yourself</a>. <BR><BR>Return to Daimyo Haochi after you have finished with your trial.<br><br>If you should die during any of your trials, visit one of the Ankh Shrines and you will be resurrected. You should retrieve your belongings from your body before returning to the Daimyo or you may not be able to return to your corpse.
1063032	Kill 3 Young Ronin or 3 Cursed Souls. Return to Daimyo Haochi when you have finished.
1063033	To view the surrounding area, you should learn about the Radar Map.<BR><BR>The Radar Map (or Overhead View) can be opened by pressing 'ALT-R' on your keyboard. It shows your immediate surroundings from a bird's eye view.<BR><BR>Pressing ALT-R twice, will enlarge the Radar Map a little. Use the Radar Map often as you travel throughout the world to familiarize yourself with your surroundings.
1063034	You are already in a guild!
1063035	Abbreviation:
1063036	A guild name cannot be more than ~1_val~ characters in length.
1063037	An abbreviation cannot exceed ~1_val~ characters in length.
1063038	Cursed Souls killed:  ~1_COUNT~
1063039	Young Ronin killed:  ~1_COUNT~
1063040	You have just gained some <a href="?ForceTopic45">Karma</a> for killing a Cursed Soul.
1063041	You have just gained some <a href="?ForceTopic45">Karma</a> for killing a Young Ronin.
1063042	Continue slaying the Cursed Souls!
1063043	Continue slaying the Young Ronin!
1063044	The first trial is complete. Return to Daimyo Haochi.
1063045	It is good that you rid the land of the Cursed Souls so they can be at peace in death. They had been cursed for doing what they thought was an honorable deed. Now they can have respect in their death.<BR><BR> I have placed a reward in your pack. <BR><BR>The second trial will test your courage. You only have to follow the yellow path to see what awaits you.
1063046	It is good that you rid the land of those dishonorable Samurai. Perhaps they will learn a greater lesson in death.<BR><BR> I have placed a reward in your pack.<BR><BR> The second trial will test your courage. You only have to follow the yellow path to see what awaits you.
1063047	Follow the yellow path. The guards will now let you through.
1063048	Whom do you wish to invite into your guild?
1063049	~1_val~ is not accepting guild invitations.
1063050	~1_val~ is already a member of your guild!
1063051	~1_val~ is already a member of a guild.
1063052	~1_val~ is currently considering another guild invitation.
1063053	You invite ~1_val~ to join your guild.
1063054	You fail to join.
1063055	You are now ignoring guild invitations.
1063056	You have joined ~1_val~.
1063057	Beyond the guards is a test of courage.  You must face your fear and attack a great beast. You must choose which beast to slay for there is more than one beyond the courtyard doors. <BR><BR>The imp entered the courtyard unaware of its surroundings. The dragon came knowingly, hunting for the flesh of humans – A feast for the beast. <BR><BR>You must rid the courtyard of these beasts but you may only choose one to attack. Go and choose wisely.
1063058	Choose your opponent and attack one with all your skill.
1063059	Fear remains in your eyes but you have learned that not all is what it appears to be. <BR><BR>You must have known the dragon would slay you instantly. You elected the weaker opponent though the imp did not come here to destroy. You have much to learn. <BR><BR>In these lands, death is not forever. The shrines can make you whole again as can a helpful mage or healer. <BR><BR>Seek them out when you have been mortally wounded. <BR><BR>The next trial will test your benevolence. You only have to walk the blue path.
1063060	You faced the dragon knowing it would be your certain death. That is the courage of a Samurai. <BR><BR>Your spirit speaks as a Samurai already. <BR><BR>In these lands, death is not forever. The shrines can make you whole again as can a helpful mage or healer. <BR><BR>Seek them out when you have been mortally wounded. <BR><BR>The next trial will test your benevolence. You only have to walk the blue path. 
1063061	The next trial will test your benevolence. Follow the blue path. The guards will now let you through.
1063062	A pack of wolves circle your feet. They have been injured and are in pain. A quick death will end their suffering.<br><br>Use your Honorable Execution skill or other means to finish off a wounded wolf. Do so and return to Daimyo Haochi.
1063063	Use your Honorable Execution skill to finish off the wounded wolf. Double click the icon in your Book of Bushido to activate the skill. When you are done, return to Daimyo Haochi.
1063064	Return to Daimyo Haochi.
1063065	<I>Daimyo Haochi smiles as you walk up to him. Quietly he says:</I><BR><BR> A Samurai understands the need to help others even as he wields a blade against them. <BR><BR>You have shown compassion. A true Samurai is benevolent even to an enemy. For this you have been rewarded. <BR><BR>And now you must prove yourself again. Walk the red path.  We will talk again later.
1063066	Follow the red path and pass through the guards to the entrance of the fourth trial.
1063067	<I>You approach a disheveled gypsy standing near a small shed. You sense that she has not eaten nor bathed in quite some time. <BR><BR>Around her is a large colony of mangy and diseased cats. It appears she has spent what little money she’s earned to feed the cats instead of herself. <BR><BR>You have a decision to make. You can give her gold so she can buy some food for her animals and herself. You can also remove the necessity of the extra mouths to feed so she may concentrate on saving herself.</i><br><br>If you elect to give the gypsy money, you can do so by clicking your stack of gold and selecting ‘1’. Then dragging it and dropping it on the Gypsy.
1063068	Give the gypsy gold or hunt one of the cats to eliminate the undue need it has placed on the gypsy.
1063069	The wolves no longer need your assistance.
1063070	You showed respect by helping another out while allowing the gypsy what little dignity she has left. <BR><BR>Now she will be able to feed herself and gain enough energy to walk to her camp. <BR><BR>The cats are her family members– cursed by an evil mage. <BR><BR>Once she has enough strength to walk back to the camp, she will be able to undo the spell. <BR><BR>You have been rewarded for completing your trial. And now you must prove yourself again. <BR><BR>Please retrieve my katana from the treasure room and return it to me.
1063071	Respect comes from allowing another to make their own decisions. By denying the gypsy her animals, you negate the respect she is due. Perhaps you will have learned something to use next time a similar situation arises. <BR><BR> And now you must prove yourself again. Please retrieve my katana from the treasure room and return it to me.
1063072	Retrieve Daimyo Haochi’s katana from the treasure room.
1063073	Give the sword to Daimyo Haochi. 
1063074	What? You have returned without the sword? Go back and look for it again.
1063075	I saw you drop the sword earlier. Take care not to lose it this time.
1063076	Thank you for returning this sword to me and leaving the remaining treasure alone. <BR><BR>Your training is nearly complete. Before you have your final trial, you should pay homage to Samurai who came before you.  <BR><BR>Go into the Altar Room and light a candle for them. Afterwards, return to me.
1063077	I thank you for returning this sword. However, you should admonished for also taking treasure that was not asked for nor given back.  <BR><BR>Think about your actions youngling. <BR><BR>Your training is nearly complete. Before you have your final trial, you should pay homage to Samurai who came before you.  <BR><BR>Go into the Altar Room and light a candle for them. Afterwards, return to me.
1063078	Light one of the candles near the altar and return to Daimyo Haochi.
1063079	You have done well young Samurai. There is but one thing left to do. <BR><BR>In the final room is the holding cell containing young Ninjas who came to take my life. They were caught and placed in my custody. <BR><BR>Take care of these miscreants and show them where your loyalty lies. <BR><BR>This is your final act as a Samurai in training.
1063080	Three young Ninja must be dealt with. Your job is to kill them. When you have done so, return to Daimyo Haochi.
1063081	That creature can only be ridden by master Tamers.

1063175	Ah, another fledgling unfurls its wings. Welcome to my home young one. <BR><BR>I am Daimyo Emino, a passionate collector of sorts. One who is vengeful towards those impeding my reign. <BR><BR>You have the look of someone who could help me but your skills are untested. Are you willing to prove your mettle as my hireling? <BR><BR>Elite Ninja Zoel awaits you in the backyard. He will lead you to the first trial. You will be directed further when you arrive at your destination. You should speak to him before exploring the yard or cave entrance.
1063176	Find Elite Ninja Zoel immediately!
1063177	<I>Zoel studies your face as you approach him. Wryly, he says:</I><BR><BR> Daimyo Emino has sent another already? The stains from the last have not yet dried! <BR><BR>No matter, we’ll finish you off and clean it all at once, eh? <BR><BR>Now to the point, your only task is to survive in the abandoned inn.<BR><BR>You will be instructed when you need to act and when you should return to one of us. <BR><BR>Only a true Ninja is deft enough to finish and remain alive.<BR><BR>Your future... or your demise... lies in this cave beyond. <BR><BR>Now go.

1063179	Enter the cave and walk through it. You will be tested as you travel along the path.

1063183	The special tile is known as a teleporter. Step on the teleporter tile and you will be transported to a new location.
1063184	<I>Daimyo Emino smiles as you approach him:</I> <BR><BR>I see that you have survived both the first trial and Zoel’s temper. <BR><BR>For that you have been rewarded with Leggings and Gloves befitting your occupation. The material is the only armor a <b><I>True Ninja</i></b> needs. <BR><BR>You have yet to prove yourself fully, young hireling. Another trial must be met. Off to Zoel you go. Bring him this note so he knows we have spoken.
1063185	Bring the note to Elite Ninja Zoel and speak with him again. He is near the cave entrance. You can hand the note to Zoel by dragging it and dropping it on his body.
1063186	A Note for Zoel
1063187	You have lost my note? I will scribe another for you. Try not to lose this one.
1063188	You decide against dropping this important note.
1063189	<I>Zoel quickly grabs the scroll from your hand and reads the note:</i> <BR><BR>Still alive then? You’ll have to impress me further before I will give my approval of you to Daimyo Emino. <BR><BR>You must return to the inn and begin the next trial. <BR><BR>We believe an associate has, shall we say, inadvertently negated our contract. <BR><BR>Find out what information you can and return to Daimyo Emino with the news. And be careful not to lose your head.<BR><BR>The Blue Teleporter Tile in Daimyo Emino’s residence will lead you to your fate. I suggest you hurry. <BR><BR>...And take care to tread softly. There is no greater traitor than a heavy footfall upon a path.
1063190	Take the Blue Teleporter Tile from Daimyo Emino's house to the Abandoned Inn. Quietly look around to gain information.
1063191	They won’t find me here.
1063192	Ah, a quiet hideout.
1063193	I wonder if I can find a sharpening stone around here.
1063194	Who locked me in this room?
1063195	Must have been strong ale to land me in this place.
1063196	You quietly approach the door and see a woman named Jedah Entille speaking to a shady figure in dark clothing. You move closer so you can overhear the conversation. Fortunately, your entrance did not alert the preoccupied party. <BR><BR>Jedah’s brash voice permeates the air:<I><BR><BR> Now that it is hidden, we’ll hide out here until Daimyo Emino forgets about us. Once he realizes his beloved sword is missing, he’ll surely start looking for the thieves. We will be long gone by that time. </I><BR><BR>After overhearing the conversation, you understand why you were sent on this trial. You must immediately tell Daimyo Emino what you have learned.
1063197	Go back through the blue teleporter and tell Daimyo Emino what you’ve overheard.
1063198	You stand on the strange floor tile but nothing happens.
1063199	<I>Daimyo Emino frowns as you relay the information. He pauses for a moment before speaking to you:</i> <BR><BR>Jedah was once one of my most promising students, but her greed will be her downfall. <BR><BR>I will send one of my disciples to deal with her later. It is more important to get that sword back first. <BR><BR>I’m counting on you to find it. She would have kept it close to her. Take the White Teleporter, located in my backyard, and check inside boxes and chests around the treasure room of the inn and return it to me when you find it.<BR><BR>Be very careful. Jedah was an expert with traps and no doubt she’s protecting the sword with them. <BR><BR>If you find a trap, try timing it and you may be able to avoid damage. <BR><BR>I’ve provided you with several heal potions in case you become injured. <BR><BR>In the bag you will also find more clothing appropriate to your new found profession. <BR><BR>Please return the sword to me. I implore you not to take anything else that may be hidden in the Inn. <BR><BR>Thank you.
1063200	Take the white teleporter and check the chests for the sword. Leave everything else behind. Avoid damage from traps you may encounter. To use a potion, make sure at least one hand is free and double click on the bottle.
1063201	A narrow hallway greets the teleporter. The enclosed space is the perfect setting for dangerous traps. Walk through the hallway being careful to avoid the traps. You may be able to time the traps to avoid injury.
1063202	Walk through the hallway being careful to avoid the traps. You may be able to time the traps to avoid injury.
1063203	The lid of the chest refuses to budge at first, but slowly you are able to pry the lid open. <BR><BR>Inside lies the sword you have been in search of.  You quickly take the sword and stash it in your backpack.  Bring the sword back to Daimyo Emino.
1063204	Take the sword and bring it back to Daimyo Emino.
1063205	Screams echo through the chamber as you walk away from the chest. Jedah’s Henchmen have become cognizant of your presence. <BR><BR>It is time for your Ninja Spirit to come alive. Slay 3 of the Henchmen before returning to Daimyo Emino. 
1063206	Kill three henchmen.
1063207	Henchmen killed:
1063208	Continue killing the henchmen!
1063209	You have not completed your duties.
1063210	You have proven your fighting skills. Bring the Sword to Daimyo Emino immediately. Be sure to follow the path back to the teleporter.
1063211	Go to Daimyo Emino. Go back through the chamber the way you came.<BR><BR> Give Daimyo Emino the sword when you've returned to his side.
1063212	What? You have returned without the sword? You need to go back and get it again!
1063213	I saw you drop the sword earlier. Take care not to lose it this time.

For that you will be rewarded.

You have earned them. Farewell for now.
1063217	You have earned these gifts for returning the sword. For that I thank you. <BR><BR>However, your reward has been lessened by your greed in the treasure room.  Do not think I did not notice your full pockets.

3010110	To wear a piece of armor or arm yourself with a weapon, left-click and drag the weapon or armor onto your <a href="?2">Paperdoll</a> character and release it.  Be warned that if you are already wearing or wielding a similar piece of equipment, you must remove that piece before you can equip the new armor, weapon or clothing.<br><br>To remove a piece of armor or disarm a weapon, left-click and drag it from your Paperdoll character into your backpack, bank box, or onto the ground.

To view the Interactive Menu for an object, left-click the object.  If you have altered the default options, you may have to use shift left-click.

3010115	Players who are new to Ultima Online have an opportunity to play the game as a young character for a length of time.  Young characters are afforded certain benefits that allow them to learn the game more easily, listed in the <a href="?18">Young Player Benefits</a> section.
3010116	For your character to receive <a href="?16">Young Status</a> and benefits thereof, your account must have less than forty hours of combined playtime.  Additionally, a character automatically loses their <a href="?16">Young Status</a> if their skill point total exceeds 450 points.
3010117	Aggressive monsters do not automatically attack you.<br><br>Vendors will buy back most items that you purchased for their full value.<br><br>You are offered special quests if you selected one of the templates during character creation.<br><br>Other players cannot attack or steal from you.<br><br>Poisoned weapons do not poison you.<br><br>You can use level zero treasure maps.<br><br>Other players cannot loot the corpses of monsters you have slain.<br><br>When you die, you are teleported to the nearest healer, and retain all your possessions.
3010118	You cannot poison others with poisoned weapons.<br><br>You cannot join a faction.
3010119	Your stats are the physical and mental attributes of your character, each of which affects other sub-characteristics of your character.  Stats increase automatically based on the skills you use, up to a maximum of 100 in any single stat, and no more than 225 in total stat points.  If you have reached the 225 stat maximum, and one of your stats increases, one of the other two stats is randomly lowered to make room.
3010120	Strength is the physical essence of your character.<br><br>Your <a href="?22">Hit Points</a> are determined by your Strength.<br><br>Your maximum carry capacity in stones is calculated by: (Strength * 7) / 2) + 40.<br><br>You receive a melee percentage damage bonus of: Strength / 5.

Magical bonuses to your Strength add directly to your Hit Points at a ratio of 1 to 1.
3010122	Intelligence is the mental capacity of your character.<br><br>Your <a href="?24">Mana</a> is determined by your Intelligence.<br><br>Your Intelligence affects the rate at which your <a href="?24">Mana</a> is regained.
3010123	Your Mana is the energy that allows you to cast <a href="?35">Magic</a>.  After expending Mana to cast a spell, it slowly recovers at a rate described in the Meditation skill section.  Your maximum Mana is the same as your <a href="?23">Intelligence</a> statistic.
3010124	Dexterity is your hand-to-eye coordination and reflexes.<br><br><a href="?26">Stamina</a> is determined by your Dexterity.
3010125	Your Stamina determines how fast you can swing a weapon.  The more Stamina you have, the faster you'll swing.  Your maximum Stamina is the same as your <a href="?25">Dexterity</a> statistic.  Several factors reduce your Stamina, including: taking damage, running, and special wrestling moves.<br><br>When you are in a non-consensual PVP area, pushing through players and monsters reduces your Stamina by 10, and you cannot push through unless you are at maximum Stamina.
3010126	In your travels throughout UO, you will eventually find yourself locked in combat with an enemy, be it monster or player.  Weapons, <a href="?35">Magic</a>, and allies can all be used to slay your foe, and should be, for a fight persists until someone runs away, someone dies, or all combatants voluntarily cease fighting.
3010127	To attack an enemy, you must first enter War Mode by clicking the War/Peace button on your <a href="?2">Paperdoll</a> (it will read 'Peace', since you are currently in Peace mode).  Once clicked, the button turns red, the text changes to War, and your character enters a fighting stance.  Double-clicking an enemy while in War Mode initiates an attack and places you in combat with them.<br><br>To leave War Mode, click the War button or press Tab.  Leaving War Mode ceases your attack.  Be careful, for it is unlikely your opponent will stop attacking you.<br><br>When you are first attacked, even while not in War Mode, you will automatically defend yourself.
3010128	When you take damage from weapon or <a href="?35">Magic</a>, your <a href="?22">Hit Points</a> are lowered.  You can raise them through being healed, unless they go below zero, in which case you will die.  You are considered to be in full health when your Hit Points are at their maximum, and you should try to maintain this state whenever possible.<br><br>You can heal with bandages by double-clicking a bandage (or stack of bandages) and targeting yourself.  This method is best suited for warriors, as it uses the Healing and Anatomy skills to determine your success.  Applying a bandage takes several seconds, and each time you take damage during that time reduces your effectiveness, so take care to run away from combat until the bandaging is complete.<br><br>Those skilled in Magery will most likely find the healing spells In Mani and In Vas Mani much more to their liking.<br><br>Those inclined in the way of the Paladin, may also use their <a href="?100">Close Wounds</a> ability to heal themselves.<br><br>Should you find yourself wounded and completely without skill in the healing arts, another player can heal you at least as well as, and often better than, they could heal themselves...if asked politely. If you are <a href="?16">Young</a>, a wandering <a href="?31">NPC</a> healer will cast spells to heal you when you approach.
3010129	When an enemy is slain, not just anyone can loot treasure from the corpse.  The right to loot is determined by the amount of damage done, with substantial weight added for those who struck the initial and killing blow.  In non-consensual PVP areas, you are allowed to loot corpses without proper rights, but doing so will flag you as a criminal and is extremely likely to paint a target on your chest.
3010130	Non-Player Characters, or NPCs, are living creatures controlled by the game engine.  They may react to your actions depending on the who, where, when and how of the situation.  The three main types of NPCs are: <a href="?32">Monsters</a>, <a href="?33">Shopkeepers</a>, and <a href="?34">Vendors</a>.
3010131	Monsters are the ever-present inhabitants of Britannia.  Most of them are terribly aggressive, and attack on sight.  A much smaller group tries to live in peace, signified by the blue coloring of their name.  Should you decide to bring your wrath upon these peace-loving denizens, your karma will eventually be lowered until you are recognized and attacked without provocation by even them.  You can gain good standing again by slaying exclusively those monsters aggressive to everyone.
3010132	Shopkeepers buy and sell goods.  They only buy that which they sell, and their stores automatically restock several times each hour, increasing to even larger amounts when completely bought out.  To interact with a shopkeeper, left-click them to display their interactive menu, and select either Buy or Sell.  If they are near enough to their shop, an appropriate menu pops up and business commences!
3010133	A vendor is a type of player-run shopkeeper who sells only goods placed on them by their owner, at prices set by their owner.  Vendors can only be placed in their owner's house, and they do not wander.  You can browse their inventory by double-clicking them and rummaging through their backpack just as you would your own.  Single left-clicking items shows you the description of the item, as well as the price.  If you wish to purchase something, say 'vendor buy' and target the item.  You are then asked to confirm your purchase.  Remember, the money is taken directly from your bank, so you don't need to travel with large sums of gold if you go on a shopping spree.
3010134	Magic is common in the lands of Ultima Online, used by all and mastered by some.  When you try to cast a spell, your Magery skill and the spell circle determine your chance for success.  If successful, your Mana is lowered by an amount required by the spell.  High circle spells are more difficult to cast, and require a fair amount of Mana and skill in Magery before they may even be attempted.  Additionally, you must possess either a spellbook or scroll containing the spell you wish to cast.<br><br>If you use a spellbook, you must also have in your backpack the reagents required to cast the spell. See <a href="?36">Spellbooks</a> for more information.<br><br>If you use a scroll, reagents are not required, and the level of the spell is 2 circles lower for purposes of minimum Magery required and success rate.  Once successfully cast, the scroll is consumed.  Double-click a scroll to cast from it.<br><br>While casting, your hands must be free.  There is one exception, in that you may hold a spellbook in your hands if desired.
3010135	Spellbooks contain a collection of permanently inscribed spells for casting.  You may open a spellbook by double-clicking it and then flip through the pages to see which spells it contains.<br><br>If you flip to the page containing a spell, you will find a listing of the reagents required and a small representative icon.  Double-clicking the icon attempts to cast the spell.  If you drag the icon from the spellbook and drop it in the gameplay window, it behaves just as if it were in the spellbook when double-clicked, creating a handy shortcut for casting the spell.<br><br>To add a spell to your spellbook: obtain a scroll with the desired spell, and then drag and drop the scroll onto your spellbook.
3010136	Reagents are the material components used to cast a spell.  They are also used by those skilled in Alchemy to create magical potions, and are thus highly sought after in the lands of Britannia.<br><br>Reagents are purchased from <a href="?33">Shopkeepers</a> in the magical and alchemical trades, and it is not uncommon to find a <a href="?34">Vendor</a> stocked with reagents as well.  They can even be picked up off the ground.  These ground-dwelling reagents tend to thrive in areas to which they are indigenous; you might find Spider Silk in a graveyard or Sulfurous Ash near a volcano.
3010137	Your bankbox is highly magical in that it is completely secure, and contains the same contents regardless of where you open it.  Your bankbox can contain no more than 125 items, but has no weight restrictions.  Stacks of items count as a single item towards the item limit.<br><br>To open your bankbox: locate a banker or minter inside a bank, left-click them to view their interactive menu and select Open Bankbox.  You can also stand next to a bank and say the word, 'Bank.'
3010138	Your skills define your character.  They are the activities in which your character most often participates and, with enough practice, excels.  Skills have a maximum trained value of 100.0, although they can go beyond that limit with rare magical items.  Additionally, you cannot exceed a total of 700 total skill points in all skills combined.
3010139	Each time you use a skill, there is a chance it will increase.  Many skills grant you a much better chance to increase if the attempt is difficult relative to its current value; these are referred to as Difficulty Based skills.  For example, around 75.0 Swordsmanship, you have a fairly good chance to gain skill by swinging your sword at an earth elemental, and almost no chance when taking on a cow or rabbit.<br><br>You can quickly get a rudimentary amount of skill from an NPC trainer.  To train, left-click an <a href="?31">NPC</a> to view their interactive menu, and select the skill you wish to train.  The NPC will tell you how much it costs to advance in the skill.   Then, just drag and drop the proper amount of gold onto them.  Note that not all NPCs can train.<br><br>If ever you find yourself in a rut and not gaining skill, first ensure you are really able to gain (see <a href="?42">Skill Locks</a>).  If everything looks good, simply try changing things up a bit - explore or try a different target.  It might just get you out of that rut, or at least make it an interesting time trying.
3010140	Practice dummies provide a safe way to learn the basics of combat and stealing - up to 25.0 points in the respective skill.  To use a practice dummy, just move in close and double-click it.  For combat practice dummies, you'll have to wield the weapon in which you wish to train before double-clicking.
3010141	Skill Locks grant you control over your skill advancement, and are manipulated in the <a href="?7">Skills Menu</a>.  To open the <a href="?7">Skills Menu</a>, press the Skills button on your Paperdoll.  A small icon is located next to each skill.  An arrow pointing up signifies the skill can only advance.  A lock signifies the skill cannot advance or degrade.  An arrow pointing down signifies the skill cannot advance, and will eventually degrade if another skill is increased while you are at your skill total maximum.  This is very important, because if no skills are pointed down once at your skill total maximum, you cannot gain in any skill.
3010142	Fame represents how well-known you are by deeds such as completing both quests and bulk order deeds, and killing monsters worth more Fame than your current level.  If you reach a high level of Fame, your professional title becomes viewable by anyone who looks at your Paperdoll.<br><br>Each time your character dies, they lose 10% of their Fame.
3010143	Karma is a measure of both the good and evil deeds you have done, and is raised and lowered by a large and diverse number of activities.  Raising your Karma might be accomplished by killing evil NPCs, giving gold to good NPCs, or casting beneficial spells on other players.  Your Karma could be lowered by using the Snooping, Stealing, Begging, or Poisoning skill, summoning Daemons, or killing good NPCs.<br><br>Your Karma affects your title.  If your Karma ever drops to the lowest level, NPC shopkeepers will refuse to do business with you.  Player-run Vendors will continue to do business with you, however.
3010144	The chance to learn a skill is increased during the first hour of play each day for each character on your account. Note this only affects the chance to increase a skill, not the chance to succeed in using it.<br><br>You will experience a power hour during your first hour of play for each character within a 24 hour period, which means that technically, the power hour will be refreshed 23 hours after the previous power hour has ended, per character. If any character does not log in for over 24 hours, their power hour will begin as soon as they log in, and last for one full hour. Every character on your account has their own burst hour.<br><br>As an example, a player who logs in at 8:00 PM local time will experience a power hour that will last until 9:00 PM. They will not be able to experience another power hour during that 24 hour period, so they will not receive another power hour until at least 8:00 PM the following day. If they do not log in again until 10:00 PM, they will experience their full power hour, beginning at 10:00 PM and lasting until 11:00 PM. The following day, they will not be able to experience a power hour until at least 10:00 PM local time.<br><br>The times stated above are YOUR time - they are not based on any form of server time. Server time zones have nothing to do with your power hour times.<br><br>Your burst time does not carry over to another day. If you don't use your entire burst hour in any 24 hour period, you forfeit any unused time.<br><br>To benefit most from your power hour, you need to use it all at once. If you log in at 10am, play for half an hour, and log out, power hour for that character will expire at 11am. It is not saved for later.<br><br>The burst system does not affect non-difficulty skills that are below base 70.0, like Anatomy, Evaluating Intelligence, and Meditation. Difficulty skills are those like Tailoring, Carpentry, and Magery, where there are always more difficult levels to attain.

3010150	Plant Growing
3010151	Using special seeds harvested from slain monsters, you may grow uniquely colored plants to use as house decorations or to produce hybrid seeds and resources. <BR><BR> As your plant grows from a seed to a full-grown plant, it will need watering and alchemical care in order to protect if from insect infestations and harmful fungi.<BR><BR>Through the process of cross-pollination, you may even be the first person to grow a unique new hybrid plant type!
3010152	Plant Bowl
3010153	In order to plant a seed, you first need a special bowl.  Plant bowls can be purchased from a provisioner for a small price.<BR><BR>Once you have an empty plant bowl, you'll need to fill it with dirt before you can plant a seed in it.<BR><BR>To fill a plant bowl with dirt, double-click the bowl to use it, and then target a source of nice soft brown dirt.  If you've targeted an appropriate patch of dirt, you'll now have a bowl full of dirt.  Add in enough water to soften the dirt, and you'll have a perfect spot for planting a <a href="?50">seed</a>!
3010154	Plant Seeds
3010155	Plant seeds come in many different colors.  When planted in a <a href="?49">bowl of dirt</a> and carefully tended to over time, plant seeds will grow into full-grown plants.  These plants can be used for <a href="?70">decorative purposes</a> only, or as a source of new <a href="?66">hybrid</a> plant seeds and specially grown <a href="?69">resources</a>.<BR><BR>While you can tell what color of plant the seed will grow into by the color of the seed itself, the type of plant that results from a particular seed remains a mystery until the plant is fully-grown!<BR><BR>The first step in growing a seed into a plant is planting it in a bowl of soft dirt.  In order to plant a seed, simply double-click the seed to use it, and then target a bowl of soft dirt.  Freshly dug dirt isn't soft enough for a seed to be planted in, so you'll need to pour <a href="?61">water</a> into your bowl of dirt before attempting to place a seed in it.
3010156	Plant Growth
3010157	Plants take time to grow through their various stages.  A plant has nine main stages of growth, from <a href="?50">seed</a>, to sapling, to fully grown plant.  Plants will not grow in containers, unless the container is in a player's backpack.  If a plant is <a href="?52">healthy</a> and well-tended, it will grow one "stage" of its life-cycle in about a day's time.  If a plant is not healthy because it has not been well taken care of, then it will not grow.  You must keep your plant in a healthy state by curing it of any maladies that might be affecting it, and then letting it heal naturally or help it along through <a href="?63">alchemical means</a>.
3010158	Plant Health
3010159	Plants have hit points much like your character.  A plant loses hit points when it is affected by various maladies.  If a plant has <a href="?53">insects</a> eating at it, then it will lose hit points each day.  Other maladies that can affect a plant's health include under or over-<a href="?61">watering</a> the plant, harmful <a href="?55">fungi</a>, <a href="?57">poison</a>, and <a href="?59">disease</a>.<BR><BR><a href="?64">Heal potions</a> and a plant's natural healing will raise the plant's hit points back up to its maximum, but only if the plant has been cured of all maladies first.<BR><BR>If a plant loses all its hit points, it will die.<BR><BR>As a plant grows, its maximum health increases.  Seeds and saplings are very weak, and can easily be killed if neglected for even a short while.  Full-grown plants, on the other hand, could survive for several days without any help.
3010160	Infestation
3010161	As a plant grows, it has a chance of being infested by insects.  These insects will slowly eat at a plant, causing it to lose <a href="?52">health</a> and eventually die.  Different plants have different chances of being infested.  Flowery plants, over-watered plants, and bright plants all have a greater chance of attracting hungry insects, so they’ll need even more attention from their owner.<BR><BR>You can use <a href="?57">poison potions</a> on your plant in order to kill off the insects that have infested it.  Be sure that you do not use too much poison, however, or your plant will soak up the poison, which can cause it to wither and die!<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?54">Infestation Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.
3010162	Infestation Level
3010163	The Infestation Level meter (grey bug image) shows the relative amount of <a href="?53">insects</a> that are currently attacking your plant.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign means the plant has a small infestation.  A red + sign indicates a severe infestation.
3010164	Fungus
3010165	As a plant grows, it has a chance of being infected with harmful fungi.  Fungi sap the plant of its health, which will cause it to wither and die.  It is important to remember that fungi love moist areas, so over-watering your plant increases the chance that it will become infected by harmful fungi.<BR><BR>You may cure your plant of fungus by using <a href="?59">cure potions</a>.<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?56">Fungus Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.
3010166	Fungus Level
3010167	The Fungus Level meter (mushroom image) shows the amount of <a href="?55">fungi</a> that are currently sapping health from your plant.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign means the plant has a small fungus infection.  A red + sign indicates a severe fungus infection.
3010168	Poison (Plants)
3010169	You may apply poison potions to your plant to kill insects infesting it.  If you apply too many poison potions, however, or apply poison potions when there are no insects on the plant, then your plant will soak up the poison and become sick.<BR><BR>When you apply poison potions, they will not take effect until the next <a href="?51">growth check</a> your plant performs (approximately once a day).  Don't worry, however, as <a href="?53">insects</a> only harm your plant during a growth check as well, so any insects will be killed off by your poison potions before they can harm your plant.<BR><BR>If you accidentally poison your plant, you can cure the plant of poison by using <a href="?64">heal potions</a> to counteract the poison.<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?58">Poison Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.
3010170	Poison Level
3010171	The Poison Level meter (skull image) shows the amount of <a href="?57">poison</a> that your plant has soaked up.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign means the plant is slightly poisoned.  A red + sign indicates that the plant is severely poisoned.
3010172	Curing (Plants)
3010173	You may apply cure potions to a plant in order to cure it of harmful <a href="?55">fungi</a>. If you apply too many cure potions, however, or apply cure potions when the plant is not infected by fungi, you will infect your plant with a deadly disease which will cause it to wither and die.<BR><BR>When you apply cure potions, they will not take effect until the next <a href="?51">growth check</a> your plant performs (approximately once a day).  Don't worry, however, as fungi only harm your plant during a growth check as well, so any harmful fungi will be cured by your cure potions before they can harm your plant.<BR><BR>If you accidentally infect your plant with a disease by over-curing it, you can use <a href="?64">heal potions</a> to counteract the disease.<BR><BR>You may view your plant's current <a href="?60">Disease Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.
3010174	Disease Level
3010175	The Disease Level meter (purple goo image) shows the strength of the <a href="?59">disease</a> affecting your plant.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign means the plant is slightly infected.  A red + sign indicates that the plant is severely infected.
3010176	Watering
3010177	In order to keep your plant healthy, you must water it regularly.  An under-watered plant will wither and die if left unattended.  However, it is important to remember that over-watering your plant is also unhealthy.  Over-watered plants become waterlogged and lose <a href="?52">health</a>, in addition to becoming perfect breeding grounds for <a href="?53">insects</a> and <a href="?55">fungi</a>.<BR><BR>Each time a plant performs its <a href="?51">growth check</a> (approximately once a day), the plant will soak up one dose of water, so you'll need to keep a constant eye on your plant to make sure it has not dried out.<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?62">Water Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.
3010178	Water Level
3010179	The Water Level meter (water pitcher image) shows the amount of <a href="?61">water</a> in your plant bowl.  Unlike other state meters, the Water Level meter displays both negative (under-watered) and positive (over-watered) levels.<BR><BR>A yellow - sign indicates the plant is slightly under-watered.  A red - sign indicates a severely under-watered plant.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign indicates the plant has been slightly over-watered.  A red + sign indicates the plant has been severely over-watered.
3010180	Potions (Plants)
3010181	You may apply various potions to a plant in order to cure it of various maladies, help it to heal back up to maximum health, or strengthen it against infestations.  Potions are applied through the Water button on the Main Menu.<BR><BR>The following potions may be used on plants :<BR><BR><a href="?64">Heal Potions</a><BR><BR><a href="?59">Cure Potions</a><BR><BR><a href="?57">Poison Potions</a><BR><BR><a href="?65">Strength Potions</a>
3010182	Heal Potions (Plants)
3010183	You may apply heal potions to a plant in order to cure it of poison or disease.  Heal potions are applied during a plant's normal <a href="?61">growth check</a>, so you will need to apply new heal potions each day if you want the plant to continue applying their beneficial effects.<BR><BR>If heal potions are applied to a plant that is not poisoned or diseased, and the plant has no other maladies currently affecting it, then the heal potions will be used to help increase the plant's current hit points (in addition to the natural healing a plant performs if it is not currently infected by any maladies).
3010184	Strength Potions (Plants)
3010185	You may apply strength potions to a plant in order to help it resist insect infestations and fungus growth.  Each strength potion applied will lower the chance of infestation by harmful maladies.  Strength potions are soaked up by a plant during its normal <a href="?61">growth check</a>, so you will need to apply new strength potions each day if you want the plant to continue applying their beneficial effects.
3010186	Cross-Pollination
3010187	When a plant first reaches its full-grown state, it will sprout its full foliage, no longer contained within the plant bowl.  At this stage of the plant's growth, it will begin to produce pollen.  You can view your plant's current <a href="?67">Pollination State</a> in the Plant Resources Menu.  The plant will eventually self-pollinate if left unattended, and the plant will begin to produce <a href="?50">seeds</a>.  Seeds produced by a self-pollinated plant will grow up into an exact duplicate of the "parent" plant.<BR><BR>Another method of pollination is called "cross-pollination".  Once a plant reaches the pollen-producing stage, its pollen may be gathered by the owner by using the Cross-Pollination button.  Gathered pollen may be used on another full-grown plant.  When you pollinate one plant with pollen from another plant, the targeted plant will produce seeds that will grow into a hybrid of the two plants.  The color and type of each "parent" plant are combined to produce a new type of seed that will grow from the targeted plant.<BR><BR>While you may continue to gather pollen from a plant throughout its entire life cycle, once a plant has been pollinated (either by itself, through natural pollination, or through manual cross-pollination from another plant), no further combinations may be performed.  The seed type that the plant will produce is determined the first time the plant is pollinized, and cannot be changed afterwards.<BR><BR>In very rare circumstances, cross-pollination may result in a "mutation".  If mutation occurs, the targeted plant will not produce seeds that are a combination of the two "parent" plants, but will instead produce "mutated" seeds that grow into mutant plant varieties.
3010188	Pollination State
3010189	The Pollination State indicator displays the current pollination state of a plant.<BR><BR>A yellow - symbol indicates that the plant has not yet produced any pollen, as it has not reached full-grown level.<BR><BR>A red ! symbol indicates that the plant has entered its pollen producing state, and can have pollen gathered from it, or be <a href="?66">cross-pollinated</a> to.<BR><BR>A green + symbol indicates that the plant has been pollinated (either by itself, through natural self-pollination, or by the pollen of another plant).  While you can still gather pollen from a plant in this state, the plant can no longer be the target of cross-pollination.
3010190	Seed Production
3010191	When a plant reaches its maximum growth level, it will no longer grow in size, but will instead produce <a href="?50">seeds</a> any time a <a href="?51">growth check</a> is performed.<BR><BR>The type of seed that a plant produces is determined by whether it pollinated itself, or if pollen from another plant was applied to it during the <a href="?66">cross-pollination</a> process.<BR><BR>A plant will produce one seed per day, up to a maximum of eight seeds.  A plant will only produce a seed if it is <a href="?52">healthy</a>.<BR><BR>You may gather seeds from a plant by using the Gather Seeds button on the Resources menu.  You will pick all available seeds from the plant and place them in your backpack, if there is room.<BR><BR>The number of seeds available is displayed next to the Seed # indicator (seed image in an empty box).<BR><BR>A red X symbol indicates that the plant has been set to <a href="?70">decorative mode</a>, or has produced its maximum amount.
3010192	Resource Production
3010193	Certain plant type and color combinations result in a plant that can produce unique resources.<BR><BR>A plant will begin producing resources at the same time it produces <a href="?50">seeds</a>, when it reaches its maximum growth level.<BR><BR>One resource is produced per day, up to a maximum of eight resources.  A plant will only produce resources if it is <a href="?52">healthy</a>.<BR><BR>You may gather resources from a plant by using the Gather Resources button on the Resources menu.  You will pick all available resources from the plant and place them in your backpack, if there is room.<BR><BR>The number of resources available is displayed next to the Resource # indicator (petal image in an empty box).<BR><BR>A red X symbol indicates that the plant has been set to <a href="?70">decorative mode</a>, or has produced its maximum amount.<BR><BR>Resources produced by unique plant combinations have special properties dependant on the resource type and color.
3010194	Decorative Mode
3010195	When a plant reaches its maximum growth level, a Decorative Mode symbol will appear in the Resources Menu.  This symbol is displayed as a leafy plant with a red / symbol through it.<BR><BR>Pressing this button (and clicking Yes to apply) will set the plant to Decorative Mode.<BR><BR>A plant set to Decorative Mode will not produce <a href="?50">seeds</a> or <a href="?69">resources</a>, and cannot be used for <a href="?66">cross-pollination</a>.  A Decorative Plant does not need upkeep, however, and is always in a <a href="?52">healthy</a> state.<BR><BR>Decorative Mode should be activated if you simply want your plant to be used as a house decoration, and therefore do not want to have to water it or keep it healthy.<BR><BR>A Decorative Plant will have the tag [decorative] displayed above it when single-clicked.<BR><BR>IMPORTANT NOTE : Once a plant is set to Decorative Mode, it cannot be set back to its normal state.  A Decorative Plant will never produce seeds or resources again.
3010196	Emptying the Bowl
3010197	If you would like to empty your plant bowl of the plant or seed and start over again, you may use the Empty Bowl button on the Main Menu.<BR><BR>If the plant in the bowl is in the <a href="?50">seed</a> or sapling stage, emptying the bowl will result in a bowl and the seed placed in your backpack.<BR><BR>If the bowl only had dirt in it, or the plant had grown beyond the sapling phase, emptying the bowl will destroy the plant, returning only the plant bowl to your backpack.
