Every cliloc message should be sorted into a text file in this folder. There are duplicate messages, they should be sorted as well (but you can put one in one text file, another in a different one, etc, as seems appropriate to you).

See "docs/MUL File Docs/english clilocentries.txt" for the entire list of cliloc entries.
