Purpose:
	This trigger allows you to make an item reject attempts to place
	an item on top of it. (Ex: Stacking shirts)
	
	This will be called whenever something is dropped on something else
	and they aren't combined (See @beforeStack and @afterStack) -
	In other words, if the items itemdefs aren't the same, or they
	aren't stackable, or if @beforeStack prevented the stacking.
	
	This will also be called if anything calls item.PutOnTopOf -
	If this trigger returns 1, then PutOnTopOf will return false (Indicating
	the attempt failed), otherwise, it will return true.
