Name:
	BeforeSave

Called on:
	Globals

When:
	Just before the worldsave starts

Arguments:
	0 (string): Absolute path of the save directory
	
Sphere Arguments:
	none

Extra variables:
	none

Return value:
	none, but is supposed to change the argument if needed

Purpose:
	This trigger allows you to decide about the directory path of the saves.
	If you want it to be something else than the default, return the new one
	as the argv[0]. Note that the returned path is used by the core only if you do not
	use the @openSaveStream trigger to change the stream.
	
	
	
	
	
Name:
	openSaveStream

Called on:
	Globals

When:
	Just before the each worldsave file is opened

Arguments:
	0 (string): Absolute path of the save directory
	1 (filename without extension): this means string like "things", "globals", etc.
	
Sphere Arguments:
	none

Extra variables:
	none

Return value:
	none, but is supposed to change the argument if needed

Purpose:
	This trigger allows you to decide about the name, encoding, etc. of the save files.
	Instead of the names of files to be saved (in the args), the trigger should set corresponding 
	Stream (binary) or TextWriter (textual) object. 
	Note that if you do supply a Stream, it will be wrapped into a StreamWriter 
	using it's default encoding (utf-8), before usage. If you do not supply anything,
	textual files with .sav extension will be created and used (TextWriter/FileStream).
	CHanges to the path (first arg) are not being taken into account in this trigger.

these two triggers are direct "opposition" of the save triggers.
