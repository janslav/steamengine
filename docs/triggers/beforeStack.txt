Name:
	BeforeStack

Called on:
	Items (Item)

When:
	Someone attempts to stack an item on this item.

Arguments:
	0 (Item): The item to be stacked on this one.
	
Sphere Arguments:
	argo: The item to be stacked on this one.

Extra variables:
	src: The character attempting to do the stacking.
	self: This item, the one having something stacked on/with it.

Return value:
	1 to cancel stacking, 0 to allow it.

Purpose:
	This trigger allows you to make an item reject stacking attempts. Stacking is also
	only allowed for items with the same itemdef, and also only if both items are marked
	stackable - That's something defined in the itemdef, so you don't have to make
	an @beforeStack script to block stacking on items, you just set stackable=0 if they're
	never stackable. This trigger is intended for items which have special tags on them,
	such as potions, which may have the potion's strength. The trigger script
	could either combine the tags somehow (averaging the potion strength), or prevent
	stacking if the tags are not compatible.
	
	If stacking proceeds, the item stacked on this one (argo) is deleted and its amount
	added to this one (self). Tags will not be migrated unless your @beforestack trigger
	does it itself.
