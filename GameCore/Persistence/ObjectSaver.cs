	/// The third way is to decorate your class with certain attributes.
	/// Basically, you will use the ISaveImplementor only for classes which you can not
	/// change, a.e. mostly the classes from .NET standard library, and that is because you have to write the
	/// saving and loading of all the data by hand. Using the Attributes, on the other hand, you can choose the rate
	/// of automatisation and own code that best suits your needs. Note that this class is NOT supposed to be used
	/// For loading of core-saveable objects, such as Things, ThinDefs, Regions, Timers, etc.
	/// On the other hand, it can and should be used to everything that can be written on one line, such as references
	/// to scripted objects (like TriggerGroups) or simple wrappers (TriggerKey, TimerKey, ...).
	/// ISimpleSaveImplementor will mostly be used for very simple classes that can be saved on one line, like valuetypes.
