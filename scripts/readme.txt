For script distro developers: 
Do not edit the stuff in scripts/defaults/chardefs or scripts/defaults/itemdefs - Those are autogenerated 
by the Importer (Well, if it's enabled, which it is here) and any changes made to them will be wiped out 
when they are re-generated.

Exception: If you are adding itemdefs or chardefs which do not exist, you can do so, but name them special -
precede their name with o_ (meaning 'original').
